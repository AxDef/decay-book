  <p>Throughout industry and science it is common today to study nature or
technological devices through models on a computer. With such models
the computer acts as a virtual lab where experiments can be done
in a fast, reliable, safe, and cheap way. In some fields, e.g., aerospace
engineering, the computer models are now so sophisticated that they
can replace physical experiments to a large extent.</p>
<p>A vast amount of computer models are based on ordinary and partial
differential equations. This book is an introduction to the
various scientific ingredients we need for reliable computing with such
type of models. A key theme is to solve differential equations
<em>numerically</em> on a computer. Many methods are available for this purpose,
but the focus here is on <em>finite difference methods</em>, because these
are simple, yet versatile, for solving a wide range of ordinary and
partial differential equations. The present chapter first presents the
mathematical ideas of finite difference methods and derives algorithms,
i.e., formulations of the methods ready for computer programming.
Then we create programs and learn how we can be sure that the programs
really work correctly.</p>
<div class="section" id="finite-difference-methods">
<span id="decay-basics"></span><h1>Finite difference methods<a class="headerlink" href="#finite-difference-methods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This section explains the basic ideas of finite difference methods
via the simple ordinary differential equation <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=-au\)</span>.
Emphasis is put on the reasoning around discretization principles and
introduction of key concepts such as mesh, mesh function,
finite difference approximations, averaging in a mesh,
derivation of algorithms, and discrete operator notation.</p>

<span class="target" id="index-0"></span><p id="index-1">Our model problem is perhaps the simplest ordinary differential
equation (ODE):</p>
<div class="math">
\[u^{\prime}(t) = -au(t){\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>In this equation, <span class="math">\(u(t)\)</span> is a scalar function of time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(a\)</span> is a constant (in this book we mostly work with <span class="math">\(a&gt;0\)</span>),
and <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}(t)\)</span> means differentiation with
respect to <span class="math">\(t\)</span>. This type of equation arises in a number of
widely different phenomena where some quantity <span class="math">\(u\)</span> undergoes
exponential reduction (provided <span class="math">\(a&gt;0\)</span>).
Examples include radioactive decay, population
decay, investment decay, cooling of an object, pressure decay in the
atmosphere, and retarded motion in fluids. Some models with growth,
<span class="math">\(a &lt; 0\)</span>, are treated as
well.
We have chosen this particular ODE not only because
its applications are relevant, but even more because studying
numerical solution methods for this particular ODE gives important insight
that can be reused in far more complicated settings, in particular
when solving diffusion-type partial differential equations.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-exact-solution">
<h3>The exact solution<a class="headerlink" href="#the-exact-solution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Although our interest is in <em>approximate</em> numerical solutions of
<span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=-au\)</span>, it is convenient to know the exact analytical
solution of the problem so we can compute the error in numerical
approximations.  The analytical solution of this ODE is found by
separation of variables, which results in</p>
<div class="math">
\[u(t) = Ce^{-at},\]</div>
<p>for any arbitrary constant <span class="math">\(C\)</span>.
To obtain a unique solution, we need a condition to fix the value of <span class="math">\(C\)</span>.
This condition is known as the <em>initial condition</em> and stated as
<span class="math">\(u(0)=I\)</span>. That is, we know that the value of <span class="math">\(u\)</span> is <span class="math">\(I\)</span> when the process
starts at <span class="math">\(t=0\)</span>. With this knowledge, the exact solution becomes
<span class="math">\(u(t)=Ie^{-at}\)</span>. The initial condition is also crucial for numerical
methods: without it, we can never start the numerical algorithms!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-complete-problem-formulation">
<h3>A complete problem formulation<a class="headerlink" href="#a-complete-problem-formulation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Besides an initial condition for the ODE, we also need to specify a
time interval for the solution: <span class="math">\(t\in (0,T]\)</span>.
The point <span class="math">\(t=0\)</span> is not
included since we know that <span class="math">\(u(0)=I\)</span> and assume that the equation governs
<span class="math">\(u\)</span> for <span class="math">\(t&gt;0\)</span>.
Let us now summarize the information that is required to
state the complete problem formulation:
find <span class="math">\(u(t)\)</span>
such that</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-decay-problem">
\[\tag{1}
u^{\prime} = -au,\ t\in (0,T], \quad u(0)=I{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>This is known as a <em>continuous problem</em> because the parameter <span class="math">\(t\)</span>
varies continuously from <span class="math">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math">\(T\)</span>. For each <span class="math">\(t\)</span> we have a corresponding
<span class="math">\(u(t)\)</span>. There are hence infinitely many values of <span class="math">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math">\(u(t)\)</span>.
The purpose of a numerical method is to formulate a corresponding
<em>discrete</em> problem whose solution is characterized by a finite number of values,
which can be computed in a finite number of steps on a computer.
Typically, we choose a finite set of time values <span class="math">\(t_0,t_1,\ldots,t_{N_t}\)</span>,
and create algorithms that generate the corresponding <span class="math">\(u\)</span> values
<span class="math">\(u_0,u_1,\ldots,u_{N_t}\)</span>.</p>

<p>Solving an ODE like <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-problem"><span class="std std-ref">(1)</span></a> by a finite difference method
consists of the following four steps:</p>

<p>The collection of points <span class="math">\(t_0,t_1,\ldots,t_{N_t}\)</span> constitutes a <em>mesh</em>
or <em>grid</em>. Often the mesh points will be uniformly spaced in
the domain <span class="math">\([0,T]\)</span>, which means that the spacing <span class="math">\(t_{n+1}-t_n\)</span> is
the same for all <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. This spacing is often denoted by <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>,
which means that <span class="math">\(t_n=n\Delta t\)</span>.</p>

<p>We say that the numerical approximation, i.e.,

A &#8220;normal&#8221; continuous function is a curve defined for all real <span class="math">\(t\)</span>

used. Usually, linear interpolation, i.e., drawing a straight line between
the mesh function values, see Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-fdu-e"><span class="std std-ref">Time mesh with discrete solution values at points and a dashed line indicating the true solution</span></a>, suffices.

<h3>Step 2: Fulfilling the equation at discrete time points<a class="headerlink" href="#step-2-fulfilling-the-equation-at-discrete-time-points" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The ODE is supposed to hold for all <span class="math">\(t\in (0,T]\)</span>, i.e., at an infinite
number of points. Now we relax that requirement and require that
the ODE is fulfilled at a finite set of discrete points in time.
The mesh points <span class="math">\(t_0,t_1,\ldots,t_{N_t}\)</span> are a natural
(but not the only) choice of points.
The original ODE is then reduced to  the following equations:</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-decay-step2">
\[\tag{4}
u^{\prime}(t_n) = -au(t_n),\quad n=0,\ldots,N_t,\quad u(0)=I{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Even though the original ODE is not stated to be valid at <span class="math">\(t=0\)</span>, it
is valid as close to <span class="math">\(t=0\)</span> as we like, and it turns out that it
is useful for construction of numerical methods to have
<a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-step2"><span class="std std-ref">(4)</span></a> valid for <span class="math">\(n=0\)</span>. The next two steps show that we

<div class="section" id="step-3-replacing-derivatives-by-finite-differences">
<span id="index-5"></span><h3>Step 3: Replacing derivatives by finite differences<a class="headerlink" href="#step-3-replacing-derivatives-by-finite-differences" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The next and most essential step of the method is to replace the
derivative <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}\)</span> by a finite difference approximation. Let us first
try a <em>forward</em> difference approximation (see Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-sketch-fe"><span class="std std-ref">Illustration of a forward difference</span></a>),</p>
<span class="target" id="index-6"></span><div class="math" id="eq-decay-fediff">
<span id="index-7"></span>\[\tag{5}
u^{\prime}(t_n) \approx \frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n}}{t_{n+1}-t_n}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The name forward relates to the fact that we use a value forward in
time, <span class="math">\(u^{n+1}\)</span>, together with the value <span class="math">\(u^n\)</span> at the point <span class="math">\(t_n\)</span>, where
we seek the derivative, to approximate <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}(t_n)\)</span>.
Inserting this approximation in <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-step2"><span class="std std-ref">(4)</span></a> results in</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-decay-step3">
\[\tag{6}
\frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n}}{t_{n+1}-t_n} = -au^{n},\quad n=0,1,\ldots,N_t-1{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Note that if we want to compute the solution
up to time level <span class="math">\(N_t\)</span>,
we only need <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-step2"><span class="std std-ref">(4)</span></a> to hold for <span class="math">\(n=0,\ldots,N_t-1\)</span> since
<a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-step3"><span class="std std-ref">(6)</span></a> for <span class="math">\(n=N_t-1\)</span> creates an equation for the final
value <span class="math">\(u^{N_t}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Also note that we use the approximation symbol <span class="math">\(\approx\)</span> in <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-fediff"><span class="std std-ref">(5)</span></a>,
but not in <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-step3"><span class="std std-ref">(6)</span></a>. Instead, we view <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-step3"><span class="std std-ref">(6)</span></a> as
an equation that is not mathematically equivalent to <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-fediff"><span class="std std-ref">(5)</span></a>,
but represents an approximation to the equation <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-fediff"><span class="std std-ref">(5)</span></a>.</p>
<p>Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-step3"><span class="std std-ref">(6)</span></a>
is the discrete counterpart to the original ODE problem
<a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-problem"><span class="std std-ref">(1)</span></a>, and often referred to as a <em>finite difference scheme</em>
or more generally as the <em>discrete equations</em> of the problem.
The fundamental feature of these equations is that they are <em>algebraic</em>
and can hence be straightforwardly solved to produce the mesh function, i.e.,
the approximate values of <span class="math">\(u\)</span> at
the mesh points: <span class="math">\(u^n\)</span>, <span class="math">\(n=1,2,\ldots,N_t\)</span>.</p>

<a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-step3"><span class="std std-ref">(6)</span></a> can be used to compute <span class="math">\(u^{n+1}\)</span> if <span class="math">\(u^n\)</span> is known.
Starting with <span class="math">\(n=0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u^0\)</span> is known since <span class="math">\(u^0=u(0)=I\)</span>, and
<a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-step3"><span class="std std-ref">(6)</span></a> gives an equation for <span class="math">\(u^1\)</span>. Knowing <span class="math">\(u^1\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(u^2\)</span> can be found from <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-step3"><span class="std std-ref">(6)</span></a>. In general, <span class="math">\(u^n\)</span>
in <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-step3"><span class="std std-ref">(6)</span></a> can be assumed known, and then we can easily solve for

<p>We shall refer to <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-fe"><span class="std std-ref">(7)</span></a> as the Forward Euler (FE) scheme
for our model problem. From a mathematical point of view,
equations of the form <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-fe"><span class="std std-ref">(7)</span></a> are known as
<em>difference equations</em> since they express how differences in
the dependent variable, here <span class="math">\(u\)</span>, evolve with <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. In our case,
the differences in <span class="math">\(u\)</span> are given by <span class="math">\(u^{n+1}-u^n = -a(t_{n+1}-t_n)u^n\)</span>.
The finite difference method can be viewed as a method for turning
a differential equation into an algebraic difference equation that
can be easily solved by repeated use of a formula like <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-fe"><span class="std std-ref">(7)</span></a>.</p>

<h3>Interpretation<a class="headerlink" href="#interpretation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There is a very intuitive interpretation of the FE scheme, illustrated
in the sketch below. We have computed some point values
on the solution curve (small red disks), and the question is how we reason
about the next point. Since we know <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(t\)</span> at the most recently
computed point, the differential equation gives us the <em>slope</em> of
the solution curve: <span class="math">\(u'=-au\)</span>. We can draw this slope as a red line
and continue the solution curve along that slope. As soon as we have
chosen the next point on this line, we have a new <span class="math">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math">\(u\)</span> value and
can compute a new slope and continue the process.</p>

<p>There is a fundamental problem with the right-hand side of
<a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-cn0"><span class="std std-ref">(13)</span></a>: we aim to compute <span class="math">\(u^n\)</span> for integer <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, which means
that <span class="math">\(u^{n+\frac{1}{2}}\)</span> is not a quantity computed by our method. The
quantity must
therefore be
expressed by the quantities that we actually produce, i.e.,
the numerical solution at the
mesh points. One possibility is to approximate <span class="math">\(u^{n+\frac{1}{2}}\)</span>
as an arithmetic mean of the <span class="math">\(u\)</span> values at the neighboring mesh points:</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-decay-uhalfavg">

<p>There are three approximation steps leading to this formula:
1) the ODE is only valid at discrete points (between the mesh points),
2) the derivative is approximated by a finite difference, and 3) the
value of <span class="math">\(u\)</span> between mesh points is approximated by an arithmetic mean
value. Despite one more approximation than for the Backward and Forward
Euler schemes, the use of a centered difference leads to a more
accurate method.</p>
<p>To formulate a recursive algorithm,
we assume that <span class="math">\(u^n\)</span> is already computed so that <span class="math">\(u^{n+1}\)</span> is the
unknown, which we can solve for:</p>

<p>The finite difference formulas for approximating the first derivative
of a function have so far been somewhat justified through graphical
illustrations in Figures <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-sketch-fe"><span class="std std-ref">Illustration of a forward difference</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-sketch-be"><span class="std std-ref">Illustration of a backward difference</span></a>,
and <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-sketch-cn"><span class="std std-ref">Illustration of a centered difference</span></a>. The task is to approximate the derivative
at a point of a curve using only two function values. By drawing
a straight line through the points, we have some approximation to
the tangent of the curve and use the slope of this line as
an approximation to the derivative. The slope can be computed by
inspecting the figures.</p>
<p>However, we can alternatively derive the finite difference formulas by
pure mathematics. The key tool for this approach is Taylor series,
or more precisely, approximation of functions by lower-order
Taylor polynomials. Given a function <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> that is sufficiently
smooth (i.e., <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> has &#8220;enough derivatives&#8221;),
a Taylor polynomial of degree <span class="math">\(m\)</span> can be used to approximate the
value of the function <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> if we know the values of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> and its
first <span class="math">\(m\)</span> derivatives at some other point <span class="math">\(x=a\)</span>. The formula for the
Taylor polynomial reads</p>
<div class="math">
\[f(x)  \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{1}{2}f''(a)(x-a)^2 +

<span id="decay-fd-op"></span><h2>Compact operator notation for finite differences<a class="headerlink" href="#compact-operator-notation-for-finite-differences" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<span class="target" id="index-25"></span><p id="index-26">Finite difference formulas can be tedious to write and read,
especially for differential equations with many terms and many
derivatives. To save space and help the reader spot the nature of the
difference approximations, we introduce a compact notation. For a
function <span class="math">\(u(t)\)</span>, a forward difference approximation is denoted by the
<span class="math">\(D_t^+\)</span> operator and written as</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-fd-d-f">
\[\tag{36}
[D_t^+u]^n = \frac{u^{n+1} - u^{n}}{\Delta t}
    \ \left( \approx \frac{d}{dt} u(t_n)\right)
    {\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The notation consists of an operator that approximates differentiation
with respect to an independent variable, here <span class="math">\(t\)</span>.  The operator is
built of the symbol <span class="math">\(D\)</span>, with the independent variable as subscript
and a superscript denoting the type of difference. The superscript
<span class="math">\(\,{}^+\)</span> indicates a forward difference.  We place square brackets
around the operator and the function it operates on and specify the
mesh point, where the operator is acting, by a superscript after the
closing bracket.</p>
<p>The corresponding operator notation for a centered difference and
a backward difference reads</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-fd-d-c">
\[\tag{37}
[D_tu]^n = \frac{u^{n+\frac{1}{2}} - u^{n-\frac{1}{2}}}{\Delta t}
    \approx \frac{d}{dt} u(t_n),\]</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-fd-d-b">
\[\tag{38}
[D_t^-u]^n = \frac{u^{n} - u^{n-1}}{\Delta t}
    \approx \frac{d}{dt} u(t_n)
    {\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Note that the superscript <span class="math">\(\,{}^-\)</span> denotes the backward
difference, while no superscript implies a central difference.</p>
<p>An averaging operator is also convenient to have:</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-fd-mean-a">
\[\tag{39}
[\overline{u}^{t}]^n = \frac{1}{2} (u^{n-\frac{1}{2}} + u^{n+\frac{1}{2}} )
    \approx u(t_n)\]</div>
<p>The superscript <span class="math">\(t\)</span> indicates that the average is taken along the time
coordinate. The common average <span class="math">\((u^n + u^{n+1})/2\)</span> can now be
expressed as <span class="math">\([\overline{u}^{t}]^{n+\frac{1}{2}}\)</span>. (When also spatial coordinates
enter the problem, we need the explicit specification of the coordinate
after the bar.)</p>
<p>With our compact notation, the Backward Euler finite difference approximation to <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=-au\)</span> can be written
as</p>
<div class="math">
\[[D_t^-u]^n = -au^n {\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>In difference equations we often place the square brackets around
the whole equation, to indicate at which mesh point the equation applies,
since each term must be approximated at the same point:</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-auto6">
\[\tag{40}
[D_t^- u  = -au]^n {\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Similarly, the Forward Euler scheme takes the form</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-auto7">
\[\tag{41}
[D_t^+ u  = -au]^n,\]</div>
<p>while the Crank-Nicolson scheme is written as</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-fd-compact-ex-cn">
\[\tag{42}
[D_t u = -a\overline{u}^t]^{n+\frac{1}{2}}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<div class="admonition-question admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Question</p>
<p class="last">By use of <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-fd-d-c"><span class="std std-ref">(37)</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-fd-mean-a"><span class="std std-ref">(39)</span></a>, are you able to
write out the expressions in <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-fd-compact-ex-cn"><span class="std std-ref">(42)</span></a> to verify that
it is indeed the Crank-Nicolson scheme?</p>
</div>
<p>The <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>-rule can be specified in operator notation by</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-decay-fd1-op-theta">
\[\tag{43}
[\bar D_t u = -a\overline{u}^{t,\theta}]^{n+\theta},{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>We define a new time difference</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-decay-fd1-du-theta">
\[\tag{44}
\lbrack\bar D_t u\rbrack^{n+\theta} = \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{t^{n+1}-t^n},\]</div>
<p>to be applied at the time point <span class="math">\(t_{n+\theta}\approx\theta t_n + (1-\theta)t_{n+1}\)</span>. This weighted average gives rise to the
<em>weighted averaging operator</em></p>
<div class="math" id="eq-decay-fd1-wmean-a">
\[\tag{45}
\lbrack\overline{u}^{t,\theta}\rbrack^{n+\theta} = (1-\theta)u^{n} + \theta u^{n+1}
    \approx u(t_{n+\theta}),\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\theta\in [0,1]\)</span> as usual. Note that for <span class="math">\(\theta =\frac{1}{2}\)</span> we recover
the standard centered difference and the standard arithmetic mean.
The idea in <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-decay-fd1-op-theta"><span class="std std-ref">(43)</span></a> is to sample the equation at
<span class="math">\(t_{n+\theta}\)</span>, use a non-symmetric difference at that
point <span class="math">\([\bar D_t u]^{n+\theta}\)</span>, and a weighted (non-symmetric) mean value.</p>
<p>An alternative and perhaps clearer notation is</p>
<div class="math">
\[[D_t u]^{n+\frac{1}{2}} = \theta [-au]^{n+1} + (1-\theta)[-au]^{n}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Looking at the various examples above and comparing them with the
underlying differential equations, we see immediately which difference
approximations that have been used and at which point they
apply. Therefore, the compact notation effectively communicates the
reasoning behind turning a differential equation into a difference
equation.</p>
