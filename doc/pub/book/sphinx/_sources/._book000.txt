Finite Difference Computing with Exponential Decay Models
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

:Authors: Hans Petter Langtangen

This easy-to-read tutorial uses a specific case, exponential decay
models, to introduce the basic ingredients of mathematical modeling on
computers: model derivation, finite difference methods, computational
algorithms, implementation in Python, software testing, visualization,
as well as detailed analysis of the quality of numerical results. The
primary focus is on how mathematical methods are translated to
reusable and well-tested software.  Many classical subjects in
scientific computing are covered in addition to software topics like
user interfaces, unit testing frameworks, class programming, and
automating computer experiments.
