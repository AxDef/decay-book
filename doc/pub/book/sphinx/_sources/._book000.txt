Finite Difference Computing with Exponential Decay Models
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

:Authors: Hans Petter Langtangen

This text provides a very simple, initial introduction to the complete
scientific computing pipeline: models, discretization, algorithms,
programming, verification, and visualization. The pedagogical strategy
is to use one case study - an ordinary differential equation
describing exponential decay processes - to illustrate fundamental
concepts in mathematics and computer science. The book is easy to read
and only requires a command of one-variable calculus and some very
basic knowledge about computer programming. Contrary to similar texts
on numerical methods and programming, this text has a much stronger
focus on implementation and teaches testing and software engineering
in particular.
