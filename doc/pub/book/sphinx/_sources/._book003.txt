Wave equations
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A very wide range of physical processes lead to wave motion, where
signals are propagated through a medium in space and time, normally
with little or no permanent movement of the medium itself.
The shape of the signals may undergo changes as they travel through
matter, but usually not so much that the signals cannot be recognized
at some later point in space and time.
Many types of wave motion can be described by the equation
:math:`u_{tt}=\nabla\cdot (c^2\nabla u) + f`, which we will solve
in the forthcoming text by finite difference methods.

Simulation of waves on a string
===============================

.. index::
   single: waves; on a string

.. index::
   single: wave equation; 1D

We begin our study of wave equations by simulating one-dimensional
waves on a string, say on a guitar or violin.
Let the string in the deformed state
coincide with the interval
:math:`[0,L]` on the :math:`x` axis, and let :math:`u(x,t)` be the displacement at
time :math:`t` in the :math:`y` direction of a point initially at :math:`x`.
The displacement function :math:`u` is governed by the mathematical model

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:

.. math::

    \tag{81}
    \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} =
        c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}, \quad x\in (0,L),\ t\in (0,T]
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:ic:u:

.. math::

    \tag{82}
    u(x,0) = I(x), \quad x\in [0,L]
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:ic:ut:

.. math::

    \tag{83}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}u(x,0) = 0, \quad x\in [0,L]
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:bc:0:

.. math::

    \tag{84}
    u(0,t)  = 0, \quad  t\in (0,T]
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:bc:L:

.. math::

    \tag{85}
    u(L,t)  = 0, \quad  t\in (0,T]
        
        

The constant :math:`c` and the function :math:`I(x)` must be prescribed.

Equation :ref:`(81) <Eq:wave:pde1>` is known as the one-dimensional
*wave equation*. Since this PDE contains a second-order derivative
in time, we need *two initial conditions*. The condition
:ref:`(82) <Eq:wave:pde1:ic:u>` specifies
the initial shape of the string, :math:`I(x)`, and
:ref:`(83) <Eq:wave:pde1:ic:ut>` expresses that the initial velocity of the
string is zero. In addition, PDEs need *boundary conditions*, give here as
:ref:`(84) <Eq:wave:pde1:bc:0>` and :ref:`(85) <Eq:wave:pde1:bc:L>`. These two
conditions specify that
the string is fixed at the ends, i.e., that the displacement :math:`u` is zero.

The solution :math:`u(x,t)` varies in space and time and describes waves that
move with velocity :math:`c` to the left and right.

Sometimes we will use a more compact notation for the partial derivatives
to save space:

.. _Eq:_auto27:

.. math::

    \tag{86}
    u_t = \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}, \quad
        u_{tt} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2},
        
        

and similar expressions
for derivatives with respect to other variables. Then the
wave equation can be written compactly as :math:`u_{tt} = c^2u_{xx}`.

.. index::
   single: wave equation; 1D, finite difference method

The PDE problem :ref:`(81) <Eq:wave:pde1>`-:ref:`(85) <Eq:wave:pde1:bc:L>` will now be
discretized in space and time by a finite difference method.

.. index::
   single: mesh; finite differences

.. _wave:string:mesh:

Discretizing the domain
-----------------------

The temporal domain :math:`[0,T]` is represented by a finite number of mesh points

.. _Eq:_auto28:

.. math::

    \tag{87}
    0 = t_0 < t_1 < t_2 < \cdots < t_{N_t-1} < t_{N_t} = T \tp   
        

Similarly, the spatial domain :math:`[0,L]` is replaced by a set of mesh points

.. _Eq:_auto29:

.. math::

    \tag{88}
    0 = x_0 < x_1 < x_2 < \cdots < x_{N_x-1} < x_{N_x} = L \tp   
        

One may view the mesh as two-dimensional in the :math:`x,t` plane, consisting
of points :math:`(x_i, t_n)`, with :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x` and :math:`n=0,\ldots,N_t`.

Uniform meshes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For uniformly distributed mesh points we can introduce the constant
mesh spacings :math:`\Delta t` and :math:`\Delta x`. We have that

.. _Eq:_auto30:

.. math::

    \tag{89}
    x_i = i\Delta x,\ i=0,\ldots,N_x,\quad
        t_n = n\Delta t,\ n=0,\ldots,N_t\tp
        
        

We also have that :math:`\Delta x = x_i-x_{i-1}`, :math:`i=1,\ldots,N_x`, and
:math:`\Delta t = t_n - t_{n-1}`, :math:`n=1,\ldots,N_t`. Figure :ref:`wave:pde1:fig:mesh`
displays a mesh in the :math:`x,t` plane with :math:`N_t=5`, :math:`N_x=5`, and constant
mesh spacings.

.. _wave:string:numerical:sol:

The discrete solution
---------------------

.. index::
   single: stencil; 1D wave equation

.. index:: mesh function

The solution :math:`u(x,t)` is sought at the mesh points. We introduce
the mesh function :math:`u_i^n`, which approximates the exact
solution at the
mesh point :math:`(x_i,t_n)` for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x` and :math:`n=0,\ldots,N_t`.
Using the finite difference method, we shall
develop algebraic equations for computing the mesh function.

.. _wave:string:samplingPDE:

Fulfilling the equation at the mesh points
------------------------------------------

In the finite difference method, we relax
the condition that :ref:`(81) <Eq:wave:pde1>` holds at all points in
the space-time domain :math:`(0,L)\times (0,T]` to the requirement that the PDE is
fulfilled at the *interior* mesh points only:

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:step2:

.. math::

    \tag{90}
    \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} u(x_i, t_n) =
        c^2\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} u(x_i, t_n),
        
        

for :math:`i=1,\ldots,N_x-1` and :math:`n=1,\ldots,N_t-1`. For :math:`n=0` we have
the initial conditions :math:`u=I(x)` and :math:`u_t=0`,
and at the boundaries :math:`i=0,N_x` we
have the boundary condition :math:`u=0`.

.. _wave:string:fd:

Replacing derivatives by finite differences
-------------------------------------------

The second-order derivatives can be replaced by central
differences. The most widely used difference approximation of
the second-order derivative is

.. math::
         \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}u(x_i,t_n)\approx
        \frac{u_i^{n+1} - 2u_i^n + u^{n-1}_i}{\Delta t^2}\tp

It is convenient to introduce the finite difference operator notation

.. math::
         [D_tD_t u]^n_i = \frac{u_i^{n+1} - 2u_i^n + u^{n-1}_i}{\Delta t^2}\tp

A similar approximation of the second-order derivative in the :math:`x`
direction reads

.. math::
         \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}u(x_i,t_n)\approx
        \frac{u_{i+1}^{n} - 2u_i^n + u^{n}_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2} = [D_xD_x u]^n_i
        \tp
        

Algebraic version of the PDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can now replace the derivatives in :ref:`(90) <Eq:wave:pde1:step2>`
and get

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:step3b:

.. math::

    \tag{91}
    \frac{u_i^{n+1} - 2u_i^n + u^{n-1}_i}{\Delta t^2} =
        c^2\frac{u_{i+1}^{n} - 2u_i^n + u^{n}_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2},
        
        

or written more compactly using the operator notation:

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:step3a:

.. math::

    \tag{92}
    [D_tD_t u = c^2 D_xD_x]^{n}_i
        \tp
        
        

Interpretation of the equation as a stencil
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A typical feature of :ref:`(91) <Eq:wave:pde1:step3b>` is that it involves
:math:`u` values from neighboring points only:
:math:`u_i^{n+1}`, :math:`u^n_{i\pm 1}`, :math:`u^n_i`, and :math:`u^{n-1}_i`.
The circles in Figure
:ref:`wave:pde1:fig:mesh` illustrate such neighboring mesh points that
contributes to an algebraic equation. In this
particular case, we have sampled the PDE at the point :math:`(2,2)`
and constructed :ref:`(91) <Eq:wave:pde1:step3b>`, which then
involves a coupling of :math:`u_2^1`, :math:`u_1^2`, :math:`u_2^2`, :math:`u_3^2`, and :math:`u_2^3`.
The term *stencil* is often used about the algebraic equation
at a mesh point, and the geometry of a typical stencil is
illustrated in Figure :ref:`wave:pde1:fig:mesh`. One also often refers
to the algebraic equations as *discrete equations*,
*(finite) difference equations* or a *finite difference
scheme*.

.. _wave:pde1:fig:mesh:

.. figure:: stencil_n_interior.png
   :width: 500

   *Mesh in space and time. The circles show points connected in a finite difference equation*

Algebraic version of the initial conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We also need to replace the derivative in the initial condition
:ref:`(83) <Eq:wave:pde1:ic:ut>` by a finite difference approximation.
A centered difference of the type

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial}{\partial t} u(x_i,t_n)\approx
        \frac{u^1_i - u^{-1}_i}{2\Delta t} = [D_{2t} u]^0_i,
        

seems appropriate. In operator notation the initial condition is
written as

.. math::
         [D_{2t} u]^n_i = 0,\quad n=0 \tp  

Writing out this equation and ordering the terms give

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:step3c:

.. math::

    \tag{93}
    u^{n-1}_i=u^{n+1}_i,\quad i=0,\ldots,N_x,\ n=0\tp
        
        

The other initial condition can be computed by

.. math::
         u_i^0 = I(x_i),\quad i=0,\ldots,N_x\tp

.. _wave:string:alg:

Formulating a recursive algorithm
---------------------------------

We assume that :math:`u^n_i` and
:math:`u^{n-1}_i` are already computed for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x`.
The only unknown quantity in :ref:`(91) <Eq:wave:pde1:step3b>` is
therefore :math:`u^{n+1}_i`, which we can solve for:

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:step4:

.. math::

    \tag{94}
    u^{n+1}_i = -u^{n-1}_i + 2u^n_i + C^2
        \left(u^{n}_{i+1}-2u^{n}_{i} + u^{n}_{i-1}\right),
        
        

where we have introduced the parameter

.. _Eq:_auto31:

.. math::

    \tag{95}
    C = c\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x},
        
        

known as the *Courant number*.


.. admonition:: :math:`C` is the key parameter in the discrete wave equation

   We see that the
   discrete version of the PDE features only one parameter, :math:`C`,
   which is therefore the key parameter that governs the
   quality of the numerical solution (see the section :ref:`wave:pde1:analysis`
   for details). Both the primary
   physical parameter :math:`c` and the numerical parameters :math:`\Delta x` and :math:`\Delta t`
   are lumped together in :math:`C`. Note that :math:`C` is a dimensionless
   parameter.




Given that :math:`u^{n-1}_i` and :math:`u^n_i` are computed for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x`,
we find new values at the next time level by applying the formula
:ref:`(94) <Eq:wave:pde1:step4>` for :math:`i=1,\ldots,N_x-1`. Figure
:ref:`wave:pde1:fig:mesh` illustrates the points that are used to
compute :math:`u^3_2`. For the boundary points, :math:`i=0` and :math:`i=N_x`, we apply
the boundary conditions :math:`u_i^{n+1}=0`.

A problem with :ref:`(94) <Eq:wave:pde1:step4>` arises when :math:`n=0` since the
formula for :math:`u^1_i` involves :math:`u^{-1}_i`, which is an undefined
quantity outside the time mesh (and the time domain). However, we can
use the initial condition :ref:`(93) <Eq:wave:pde1:step3c>` in combination with
:ref:`(94) <Eq:wave:pde1:step4>` when :math:`n=0` to eliminate :math:`u^{-1}_i` and
arrive at a special formula for :math:`u_i^1`:

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:step4:1:

.. math::

    \tag{96}
    u_i^1 = u^0_i - \half
        C^2\left(u^{0}_{i+1}-2u^{0}_{i} + u^{0}_{i-1}\right)
        \tp
        
        

Figure :ref:`wave:pde1:fig:stencil:u1` illustrates how :ref:`(96) <Eq:wave:pde1:step4:1>`
connects four instead of five points: :math:`u^1_2`, :math:`u_1^0`, :math:`u_2^0`, and :math:`u_3^0`.

.. _wave:pde1:fig:stencil:u1:

.. figure:: stencil_n0_interior.png
   :width: 500

   *Modified stencil for the first time step*

We can now summarize the computational algorithm:

1. Compute :math:`u^0_i=I(x_i)` for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x`

2. Compute :math:`u^1_i` by :ref:`(96) <Eq:wave:pde1:step4:1>` and set :math:`u_i^1=0`
   for the boundary points :math:`i=0` and :math:`i=N_x`, for :math:`n=1,2,\ldots,N-1`,

3. For each time level :math:`n=1,2,\ldots,N_t-1`

  1. apply :ref:`(94) <Eq:wave:pde1:step4>` to find :math:`u^{n+1}_i` for :math:`i=1,\ldots,N_x-1`

  2. set :math:`u^{n+1}_i=0` for the boundary points :math:`i=0`, :math:`i=N_x`.

The algorithm essentially consists of moving
a finite difference stencil through all the mesh points, which can be
seen as an animation in a `web page <http://tinyurl.com/opdfafk/pub/mov-wave/wave1D_PDE_Dirichlet_stencil_gpl/index.html>`__
or a `movie file <http://tinyurl.com/opdfafk/pub/mov-wave/wave1D_PDE_Dirichlet_stencil_gpl/movie.ogg>`__.

.. _wave:string:impl:

Sketch of an implementation
---------------------------

In a Python implementation of this algorithm, we use the array
elements ``u[i]`` to store :math:`u^{n+1}_i`, ``u_1[i]`` to store :math:`u^n_i`, and
``u_2[i]`` to store :math:`u^{n-1}_i`. Our naming convention is use ``u`` for the
unknown new spatial field to be computed, ``u_1`` as the solution at
one time step back in time, ``u_2`` as the solution two time steps back
in time and so forth.

The algorithm only involves the three most recent time levels, so we
need only three arrays for :math:`u_i^{n+1}`, :math:`u_i^n`, and :math:`u_i^{n-1}`,
:math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x`.  Storing all the solutions in a two-dimensional
array of size :math:`(N_x+1)\times (N_t+1)` would be possible in this simple
one-dimensional PDE problem, but is normally out of the question in
three-dimensional (3D) and large two-dimensional (2D) problems. We
shall therefore, in all our PDE solving programs, have the unknown in
memory at as few time levels as possible.

The following Python snippet realizes the steps in the computational
algorithm.

.. code-block:: python

        # Given mesh points as arrays x and t (x[i], t[n])
        dx = x[1] - x[0]
        dt = t[1] - t[0]
        C = c*dt/dx            # Courant number
        Nt = len(t)-1
        C2 = C**2              # Help variable in the scheme
        
        # Set initial condition u(x,0) = I(x)
        for i in range(0, Nx+1):
            u_1[i] = I(x[i])
        
        # Apply special formula for first step, incorporating du/dt=0
        for i in range(1, Nx):
            u[i] = u_1[i] - 0.5*C**2(u_1[i+1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[i-1])
        u[0] = 0;  u[Nx] = 0   # Enforce boundary conditions
        
        # Switch variables before next step
        u_2[:], u_1[:] = u_1, u
        
        for n in range(1, Nt):
            # Update all inner mesh points at time t[n+1]
            for i in range(1, Nx):
                u[i] = 2u_1[i] - u_2[i] - \ 
                       C**2(u_1[i+1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[i-1])
        
            # Insert boundary conditions
            u[0] = 0;  u[Nx] = 0
        
            # Switch variables before next step
            u_2[:], u_1[:] = u_1, u

Verification          (3)
=========================

Before implementing the algorithm, it is convenient to add a source
term to the PDE :ref:`(81) <Eq:wave:pde1>`
since it gives us more freedom in finding test problems for
verification. Physically, a source term acts as a generation of waves
in the interior of the domain.

.. _wave:pde2:fd:

A slightly generalized model problem
------------------------------------

We now address the following extended initial-boundary value problem
for one-dimensional wave phenomena:

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:

.. math::

    \tag{97}
    u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} + f(x,t), \quad x\in (0,L),\ t\in (0,T]
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:ic:u:

.. math::

    \tag{98}
    u(x,0) = I(x), \quad x\in [0,L]
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:ic:ut:

.. math::

    \tag{99}
    u_t(x,0) = V(x), \quad x\in [0,L]
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:bc:0:

.. math::

    \tag{100}
    u(0,t)  = 0, \quad  t>0
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:bc:L:

.. math::

    \tag{101}
    u(L,t)  = 0, \quad  t>0
        
        

Sampling the PDE at :math:`(x_i,t_n)` and using the same finite difference
approximations as above, yields

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:fdop:

.. math::

    \tag{102}
    [D_tD_t u = c^2 D_xD_x u + f]^{n}_i
        \tp
        
        

Writing this out and solving for the unknown :math:`u^{n+1}_i` results in

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:step3b:

.. math::

    \tag{103}
    u^{n+1}_i = -u^{n-1}_i + 2u^n_i + C^2
        (u^{n}_{i+1}-2u^{n}_{i} + u^{n}_{i-1}) + \Delta t^2 f^n_i
        
        \tp
        

The equation for the first time step must be rederived. The discretization
of the initial condition :math:`u_t = V(x)` at :math:`t=0`
becomes

.. math::
         [D_{2t}u = V]^0_i\quad\Rightarrow\quad u^{-1}_i = u^{1}_i - 2\Delta t V_i,

which, when inserted in :ref:`(103) <Eq:wave:pde2:step3b>` for :math:`n=0`, gives
the special formula

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:step3c:

.. math::

    \tag{104}
    u^{1}_i = u^0_i - \Delta t V_i + {\half}
        C^2
        \left(u^{0}_{i+1}-2u^{0}_{i} + u^{0}_{i-1}\right) + \half\Delta t^2 f^0_i
        
        \tp
        

.. _wave:pde2:fd:standing:waves:

Using an analytical solution of physical significance
-----------------------------------------------------

Many wave problems feature sinusoidal oscillations in time
and space. For example, the original PDE problem
:ref:`(81) <Eq:wave:pde1>`-:ref:`(85) <Eq:wave:pde1:bc:L>` allows an exact solution

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:test:ue:

.. math::

    \tag{105}
    \uex(x,t)) = A\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{L}x\right)
        \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{L}ct\right)\tp
        
        

This :math:`\uex` fulfills the PDE with :math:`f=0`, boundary conditions
:math:`\uex(0,t)=\uex(L,0)=0`, as well as initial
conditions :math:`I(x)=A\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{L}x\right)` and :math:`V=0`.

It is common to use such exact solutions of physical interest
to verify implementations. However, the numerical
solution :math:`u^n_i` will only be an approximation to :math:`\uex(x_i,t_n)`.
We have no knowledge of the precise size of the error in
this approximation, and therefore we can never know if discrepancies
between :math:`u^n_i` and :math:`\uex(x_i,t_n)` are caused
by mathematical approximations or programming errors.
In particular, if a plot of the computed solution :math:`u^n_i` and
the exact one \eq:ref:`wave:pde2:test:ue` looks similar, many
are tempted to claim that the implementation works. However,
even if color plots look nice and the accuracy is "deemed good",
there can still be serious programming errors present!

The only way to use exact physical solutions like
:ref:`(105) <Eq:wave:pde2:test:ue>` for serious and thorough verification is to
run a series of finer and finer meshes, measure the integrated error
in each mesh, and from this information estimate the empirical convergence
rate of the method.
An introduction to the computing convergence rates is given in
the section
on `convergence rates <http://hplgit.github.io/decay-book/doc/pub/book/sphinx/._book007.html#computing-convergence-rates>`__ in [Ref2]_.
There is also a detailed example on computing convergence rates in
the section :ref:`vib:ode1:verify`.

In the present problem, one expects the method to have a convergence rate
of 2 (see the section :ref:`wave:pde1:analysis`), so if the computed rates
are close to 2 on a sufficiently mesh, we have good evidence that
the implementation is free of programming mistakes.

Manufactured solution
---------------------

One problem with the exact solution :ref:`(105) <Eq:wave:pde2:test:ue>` is
that it requires a simplification (:math:`V=0, f=0`) of the implemented problem
:ref:`(97) <Eq:wave:pde2>`-:ref:`(101) <Eq:wave:pde2:bc:L>`. An advantage of using
a *manufactured solution* is that we can test all terms in the
PDE problem. The idea of this approach is to set up some chosen
solution and fit the source term, boundary conditions, and initial
conditions to be compatible with the chosen solution.
Given that our boundary conditions in the implementation are
:math:`u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0`, we must choose a solution that fulfills these
conditions. One example is

.. math::
         \uex(x,t) = x(L-x)\sin t\tp

Inserted in the PDE :math:`u_{tt}=c^2u_{xx}+f` we get

.. math::
         -x(L-x)\sin t = -c^2 2\sin t + f\quad\Rightarrow f = (2c^2 - x(L-x))\sin t\tp

The initial conditions become

.. math::
        
        u(x,0) =& I(x) = 0,\\ 
        u_t(x,0) &= V(x) = x(L-x)\tp
        

To verify the code, we compute the convergence rates in a series of
simulations, letting each simulation use a finer mesh than the
previous one. Such empirical estimation of convergence rates
tests rely on an assumption that some
measure :math:`E` of the numerical error is related to the discretization
parameters through

.. math::
         E = C_t\Delta t^r + C_x\Delta x^p,

where :math:`C_t`, :math:`C_x`, :math:`r`, and :math:`p` are constants. The constants
:math:`r` and :math:`p` are known as the *convergence rates* in time and space,
respectively.
From the
accuracy in the finite difference approximations, we expect :math:`r=p=2`,
since the error terms are of order :math:`\Delta t^2` and :math:`\Delta x^2`.
This is confirmed by truncation error analysis and other types of analysis.

By using an exact solution of the PDE problem, we will next compute
the error measure :math:`E` on a sequence of refined meshes and see if
the rates :math:`r=p=2` are obtained. We will not be concerned with estimating
the constants :math:`C_t` and :math:`C_x`.

It is advantageous to introduce a single discretization parameter
:math:`h=\Delta t=\hat c \Delta x` for some constant :math:`\hat c`.
Since :math:`\Delta t` and :math:`\Delta x`
are related through the Courant number, :math:`\Delta t = C\Delta x/c`, we
set :math:`h=\Delta t`, and then :math:`\Delta x = hc/C`.
Now the expression for the error measure is greatly simplified:

.. math::
         E = C_t\Delta t^r + C_x\Delta x^r = C_t h^r + C_x\left(\frac{c}{C}\right)^r h^r
        = Dh^r,\quad D = C_t+C_x\left(\frac{c}{C}\right)^r \tp

We choose an initial discretization parameter :math:`h_0` and run
experiments with decreasing :math:`h`: :math:`h_i=2^{-i}h_0`, :math:`i=1,2,\ldots,m`.
Halving :math:`h` in each experiment is not necessary, but it is a common choice.
For each experiment we must record :math:`E` and :math:`h`.
A standard choice of error measure
is the :math:`\ell^2` or :math:`\ell^\infty` norm of
the error mesh function :math:`e^n_i`:

.. _Eq:_auto32:

.. math::

    \tag{106}
    E = ||e^n_i||_{\ell^2} = \left( \Delta t\Delta x
        \sum_{n=0}^{N_t}\sum_{i=0}^{N_x}
        (e^n_i)^2\right)^{\half},\quad e^n_i = \uex(x_i,t_n)-u^n_i,
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto33:

.. math::

    \tag{107}
    E = ||e^n_i||_{\ell^\infty} = \max_{i,n} |e^i_n|\tp
        
        

In Python, one can compute :math:`\sum_{i}(e^{n}_i)^2` at each time step
and accumulate the value in some sum variable, say ``e2_sum``.  At the
final time step one can do ``sqrt(dt*dx*e2_sum)``.  For the
:math:`\ell^\infty` norm one must compare the maximum error at a time level
(``e.max()``) with the global maximum over the time domain: ``e_max =
max(e_max, e.max())``.

An alternative error measure
is to use a spatial norm at one time step only, e.g.,
the end time :math:`T` (:math:`n=N_t`):

.. _Eq:_auto34:

.. math::

    \tag{108}
    E = ||e^n_i||_{\ell^2} = \left( \Delta x\sum_{i=0}^{N_x}
        (e^n_i)^2\right)^{\half},\quad e^n_i = \uex(x_i,t_n)-u^n_i,
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto35:

.. math::

    \tag{109}
    E = ||e^n_i||_{\ell^\infty} = \max_{0\leq i\leq N_x} |e^{n}_i|\tp
        
        

The important issue is that our error measure :math:`E` must be one number
that represents the error in the simulation.

Let :math:`E_i` be the error measure in experiment (mesh) number :math:`i` and
let :math:`h_i` be the corresponding discretization parameter (:math:`h`).
With the error model :math:`E_i = Dh_i^r`, we can
estimate :math:`r` by comparing two consecutive
experiments:

.. math::
        
        E_{i+1}& =D h_{i+1}^{r},\\ 
        E_{i}& =D h_{i}^{r}\tp
        

Dividing the two equations eliminates the (uninteresting) constant :math:`D`.
Thereafter, solving for :math:`r` yields

.. math::
         r = \frac{\ln E_{i+1}/E_{i}}{\ln h_{i+1}/h_{i}}\tp
        

Since :math:`r` depends on :math:`i`, i.e., which simulations we compare,
we add an index to :math:`r`: :math:`r_i`, where :math:`i=0,\ldots,m-2`, if we
have :math:`m` experiments: :math:`(h_0,E_0),\ldots,(h_{m-1}, E_{m-1})`.

In our present discretization of the wave equation we expect :math:`r=2`, and
hence the :math:`r_i` values should converge to 2 as :math:`i` increases.

.. _wave:pde2:fd:verify:quadratic:

Constructing an exact solution of the discrete equations
--------------------------------------------------------

With a manufactured or known analytical solution, as outlined above,
we can estimate convergence rates and see if they have the correct
asymptotic behavior. Experience shows that this is a quite good
verification technique in that many common bugs will destroy the
convergence rates. A significantly better test though,
would be to check that the
numerical solution is exactly what it should be. This will in general
require exact knowledge of the numerical error, which we do not normally have
(although we in the section :ref:`wave:pde1:analysis` establish such knowledge
in simple cases).
However, it is possible to look for solutions where we can show that
the numerical error vanishes, i.e., the solution of the original continuous
PDE problem is
also a solution of the discrete equations. This property often arises
if the exact solution of the PDE
is a lower-order polynomial. (Truncation error
analysis leads to error measures that involve derivatives of the
exact solution. In the present problem, the truncation error involves
4th-order derivatives of :math:`u` in space and time. Choosing :math:`u`
as a polynomial of degree three or less
will therefore lead to vanishing error.)

We shall now illustrate the construction of an exact solution to both the
PDE itself and the discrete equations.
Our chosen manufactured solution is quadratic in space
and linear in time. More specifically, we set

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:fd:verify:quadratic:uex:

.. math::

    \tag{110}
    \uex (x,t) = x(L-x)(1+{\half}t),
        
        

which by insertion in the PDE leads to :math:`f(x,t)=2(1+t)c^2`. This :math:`\uex`
fulfills the boundary conditions :math:`u=0` and demands :math:`I(x)=x(L-x)`
and :math:`V(x)={\half}x(L-x)`.

To realize that the chosen :math:`\uex` is also an exact
solution of the discrete equations,
we first remind ourselves that :math:`t_n=n\Delta t` before we
establish that

.. _Eq:_auto36:

.. math::

    \tag{111}
    \lbrack D_tD_t t^2\rbrack^n = \frac{t_{n+1}^2 - 2t_n^2 + t_{n-1}^2}{\Delta t^2}
        = (n+1)^2 -2n^2 + (n-1)^2 = 2,
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto37:

.. math::

    \tag{112}
    \lbrack D_tD_t t\rbrack^n = \frac{t_{n+1} - 2t_n + t_{n-1}}{\Delta t^2}
        = \frac{((n+1) -2n + (n-1))\Delta t}{\Delta t^2} = 0
        \tp
        
        

Hence,

.. math::
         [D_tD_t \uex]^n_i = x_i(L-x_i)[D_tD_t (1+{\half}t)]^n =
        x_i(L-x_i){\half}[D_tD_t t]^n = 0\tp

Similarly, we get that

.. math::
        
        \lbrack D_xD_x \uex\rbrack^n_i &=
        (1+{\half}t_n)\lbrack D_xD_x (xL-x^2)\rbrack_i =
        (1+{\half}t_n)\lbrack LD_xD_x x - D_xD_x x^2\rbrack_i \\ 
        &= -2(1+{\half}t_n)
        \tp
        

Now, :math:`f^n_i = 2(1+{\half}t_n)c^2`, which results in

.. math::
         [D_tD_t \uex - c^2D_xD_x\uex - f]^n_i = 0 - c^2(-1)2(1 + {\half}t_n
        + 2(1+{\half}t_n)c^2 = 0\tp

Moreover, :math:`\uex(x_i,0)=I(x_i)`,
:math:`\partial \uex/\partial t = V(x_i)` at :math:`t=0`, and
:math:`\uex(x_0,t)=\uex(x_{N_x},0)=0`. Also the modified scheme for the
first time step is fulfilled by :math:`\uex(x_i,t_n)`.

Therefore, the exact solution :math:`\uex(x,t)=x(L-x)(1+t/2)`
of the PDE problem is also an exact solution of the discrete problem.
We can use this result to check that the computed :math:`u^n_i` values from
an implementation equals :math:`\uex(x_i,t_n)` within machine precision,
*regardless of the mesh spacings* :math:`\Delta x` and :math:`\Delta t`!
Nevertheless, there might be stability
restrictions on :math:`\Delta x` and :math:`\Delta t`, so the test can only be
run for a mesh that is compatible with the stability criterion (which
in the present case is :math:`C\leq 1`, to be derived later).


.. note::
   A product of quadratic or linear expressions in the various
   independent variables, as shown above, will often fulfill both the
   PDE problem and the discrete equations, and can therefore be very useful
   solutions for verifying implementations.
   
   However, for 1D wave
   equations of the type :math:`u_{tt}=c^2u_{xx}` we shall see that there is always
   another much more powerful way of generating exact
   solutions (which consists in just setting :math:`C=1` (!), as shown in
   the section :ref:`wave:pde1:analysis`).




.. _wave:pde1:impl:

Implementation          (4)
===========================

.. index::
   single: wave equation; 1D, implementation

This section presents the complete computational algorithm, its
implementation in Python code, animation of the solution, and
verification of the implementation.

A real implementation of the basic computational algorithm from
the sections :ref:`wave:string:alg` and :ref:`wave:string:impl` can be
encapsulated in a function, taking all the input data for the problem
as arguments.  The physical input data consists of :math:`c`, :math:`I(x)`,
:math:`V(x)`, :math:`f(x,t)`, :math:`L`, and :math:`T`.  The numerical input is the mesh
parameters :math:`\Delta t` and :math:`\Delta x`.

Instead of specifying :math:`\Delta t` *and* :math:`\Delta x`, we can specify one
of them and the Courant number :math:`C` instead, since having explicit
control of the Courant number is convenient when investigating the
numerical method. Many find it natural to prescribe the resolution of
the spatial grid and set :math:`N_x`. The solver function can then compute
:math:`\Delta t = CL/(cN_x)`. However, for comparing :math:`u(x,t)` curves (as
functions of :math:`x`) for various Courant numbers
it is more convenient to keep :math:`\Delta t` fixed for
all :math:`C` and let :math:`\Delta x` vary according to :math:`\Delta x = c\Delta t/C`.
With :math:`\Delta t` fixed, all frames correspond to the same time :math:`t`,
and this simplifies animations that compare simulations with different
mesh resolutions. Plotting functions of :math:`x`
with different spatial resolution is trivial,
so it is easier to let :math:`\Delta x` vary in the simulations than :math:`\Delta t`.

Callback function for user-specific actions
-------------------------------------------

.. index:: callback function

The solution at all spatial points at a new time level is stored in an
array ``u`` of length :math:`N_x+1`. We need to decide what do to with
this solution, e.g., visualize the curve, analyze the values, or write
the array to file for later use. The decision about what to do is left to
the user in the form of a user-suppled supplied function

.. code-block:: python

        user_action(u, x, t, n)

where ``u`` is the solution at the spatial points ``x`` at time ``t[n]``.
The ``user_action`` function is call from the solver at each time level ``n``.

If the user wants to plot the solution or store the solution at a
time point, she needs to write such a function and take appropriate
actions inside it. We will show examples on many such ``user_action``
functions.

Since the solver function make calls back to the user's code
via such a function, this type of function is called a *callback function*.
When writing general software, like our solver function, which also needs
to carry out special problem-dependent actions (like visualization),
it is a common technique to leave those actions to user-supplied
callback functions.

Visualization: animating the solution
-------------------------------------

Now that we have verified the implementation it is time to do a
real computation where we also display the evolution of the waves
on the screen. Since the ``solver`` function knows nothing about
what type of visualizations we may want, it calls the callback function
``user_action(u, x, t, n)``. We must therefore write this function and
find the proper statements for plotting the solution.

Dissection of the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``viz`` function can either use SciTools or Matplotlib for
visualizing the solution. The ``user_action`` function based on SciTools
is called ``plot_u_st``, while the ``user_action`` function based on
Matplotlib is a bit more complicated as it is realized as a class and
needs statements that differ from those for making static plots.
SciTools can utilize both Matplotlib and Gnuplot (and many other
plotting programs) for doing the graphics, but Gnuplot is a relevant
choice for large :math:`N_x` or in two-dimensional problems
as Gnuplot is significantly faster than
Matplotlib for screen animations.

.. index:: closure

A function inside another function, like ``plot_u_st`` in the above code
segment, has access to *and remembers* all the local variables in the
surrounding code inside the ``viz`` function (!). This is known in
computer science as a *closure* and is very convenient to program
with. For example, the ``plt`` and ``time`` modules defined outside
``plot_u`` are accessible for ``plot_u_st`` when the function is called
(as ``user_action``) in the ``solver`` function.  Some may think, however,
that a class instead of a closure is a cleaner and
easier-to-understand implementation of the user action function, see
the section :ref:`wave:pde2:software`.

The ``plot_u_st`` function just makes a standard SciTools ``plot`` command
for plotting ``u`` as a function of ``x`` at time ``t[n]``.  To achieve a
smooth animation, the ``plot`` command should take keyword arguments
instead of being broken into separate calls to ``xlabel``, ``ylabel``,
``axis``, ``time``, and ``show``.  Several ``plot`` calls will automatically
cause an animation on the screen. In addition, we want to save each
frame in the animation to file. We then need a filename where the
frame number is padded with zeros, here ``tmp_0000.png``,
``tmp_0001.png``, and so on.  The proper printf construction is then
``tmp_%04d.png``.
The section :ref:`vib:ode1:anim` contains more basic
information on making animations.

The solver is called with an argument ``plot_u`` as ``user_function``.
If the user chooses to use SciTools, ``plot_u`` is the ``plot_u_st``
callback function, but for Matplotlib it is an instance of the
class ``PlotMatplotlib``. Also this class makes use of variables
defined in the ``viz`` function: ``plt`` and ``time``.
With Matplotlib, one has to make the first plot the standard way, and
then update the :math:`y` data in the plot at every time level. The update
requires active use of the returned value from ``plt.plot`` in the first
plot.  This value would need to be stored in a local variable if we
were to use a closure for the ``user_action`` function when doing the
animation with Matplotlib. It is much easier to store the
variable as a class attribute ``self.lines``. Since the class is essentially a
function, we implement the function as the special method ``__call__``
such that the instance ``plot_u(u, x, t, n)`` can be called as a standard
callback function from ``solver``.

Making movie files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the
``frame_*.png`` files containing the frames in the animation we can
make video files.
The section :ref:`vib:ode1:anim` presents basic information on how to
use the ``ffmpeg`` (or ``avconv``) program for producing video files
in different modern formats: Flash, MP4, Webm, and Ogg.

The ``viz`` function creates a ``ffmpeg`` or ``avconv`` command
with the proper arguments for each of the formats Flash, MP4, WebM,
and Ogg. The task is greatly simplified by having a
``codec2ext`` dictionary for mapping
video codec names to filename extensions.
As mentioned in the section :ref:`vib:ode1:anim`, only
two formats are actually needed to ensure that all browsers can
successfully play the video: MP4 and WebM.

Some animations consisting of a large number of plot files may not
be properly combined into a video using ``ffmpeg`` or ``avconv``.
A method that always works is to play the PNG files as an animation
in a browser using JavaScript code in an HTML file.
The SciTools package has a function ``movie`` (or a stand-alone command
``scitools movie``) for creating such an HTML player. The ``plt.movie``
call in the ``viz`` function shows how the function is used.
The file ``movie.html`` can be loaded into a browser and features
a user interface where the speed of the animation can be controlled.
Note that the movie in this case consists of the ``movie.html`` file
and all the frame files ``tmp_*.png``.

Skipping frames for animation speed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes the time step is small and :math:`T` is large, leading to an
inconveniently large number of plot files and a slow animation on the
screen. The solution to such a problem is to decide on a total number
of frames in the animation, ``num_frames``, and plot the solution only for
every ``skip_frame`` frames. For example, setting ``skip_frame=5`` leads
to plots of every 5 frames. The default value ``skip_frame=1`` plots
every frame.
The total number of time levels (i.e., maximum
possible number of frames) is the length of ``t``, ``t.size`` (or ``len(t)``),
so if we want ``num_frames`` frames in the animation,
we need to plot every ``t.size/num_frames`` frames:

.. code-block:: python

        skip_frame = int(t.size/float(num_frames))
        if n % skip_frame == 0 or n == t.size-1:
            st.plot(x, u, 'r-', ...)

The initial condition (``n=0``) included by ``n % skip_frame == 0``,
as well as every ``skip_frame``-th frame.
As ``n % skip_frame == 0`` will very seldom be true for the
very final frame, we must also check if ``n == t.size-1`` to
get the final frame included.

A simple choice of numbers may illustrate the formulas: say we have
801 frames in total (``t.size``) and we allow only 60 frames to be
plotted. Then we need to plot every 801/60 frame, which with integer
division yields 13 as ``every``. Using the mod function, ``n % every``,
this operation is zero every time ``n`` can be divided by 13 without a
remainder. That is, the ``if`` test is true when ``n`` equals :math:`0, 13, 26,
39, ..., 780, 801`. The associated code is included in the ``plot_u``
function in the file `wave1D_u0v.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave1D/wave1D_u0v.py>`__.

.. _wave:pde1:guitar:data:

Running a case
--------------

The first demo of our 1D wave equation solver concerns vibrations of a
string that is initially deformed to a triangular shape, like when picking
a guitar string:

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:guitar:I:

.. math::

    \tag{113}
    I(x) = \left\lbrace
        \begin{array}{ll}
        ax/x_0, & x < x_0,\\ 
        a(L-x)/(L-x_0), & \hbox{otherwise}
        \end{array}\right.
        
        

We choose :math:`L=75` cm, :math:`x_0=0.8L`, :math:`a=5` mm, and a time frequency
:math:`\nu = 440` Hz. The relation between the wave speed :math:`c` and :math:`\nu` is
:math:`c=\nu\lambda`, where :math:`\lambda` is the wavelength, taken as :math:`2L` because
the longest wave on the string form half a wavelength. There is no
external force, so :math:`f=0`, and the string is at rest initially so
that :math:`V=0`.

Regarding numerical parameters, we need to specify a :math:`\Delta t`.
Sometimes it is more natural to think of a spatial resolution instead
of a time step. A natural semi-coarse spatial resolution in the present
problem is :math:`N_x=50`. We can then choose the associated :math:`\Delta t` (as required
by the ``viz`` and ``solver`` functions) as the stability limit:
:math:`\Delta t = L/(N_xc)`. This is the :math:`\Delta t` to be specified,
but notice that if :math:`C<1`, the actual :math:`\Delta x` computed in ``solver`` gets
larger than :math:`L/N_x`: :math:`\Delta x = c\Delta t/C = L/(N_xC)`. (The reason
is that we fix :math:`\Delta t` and adjust :math:`\Delta x`, so if :math:`C` gets
smaller, the code implements this effect in terms of a larger :math:`\Delta x`.)

A function for setting the physical and numerical parameters and
calling ``viz`` in this application goes as follows:

.. code-block:: python

        def guitar(C):
            """Triangular wave (pulled guitar string)."""
            L = 0.75
            x0 = 0.8*L
            a = 0.005
            freq = 440
            wavelength = 2*L
            c = freq*wavelength
            omega = 2*pi*freq
            num_periods = 1
            T = 2*pi/omega*num_periods
            # Choose dt the same as the stability limit for Nx=50
            dt = L/50./c
        
            def I(x):
                return a*x/x0 if x < x0 else a/(L-x0)*(L-x)
        
            umin = -1.2*a;  umax = -umin
            cpu = viz(I, 0, 0, c, L, dt, C, T, umin, umax,
                      animate=True, tool='scitools')

The associated program has the name `wave1D_u0.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave1D/wave1D_u0.py>`__. Run
the program and watch the `movie of the vibrating string <http://tinyurl.com/opdfafk/pub/mov-wave/guitar_C0.8/index.html>`__.

[**hpl 10**: Must recompute these movies as :math:`\Delta t` is different when :math:`C<1`.]

Working with a scaled PDE model
-------------------------------

Depending on the model, it may be a substantial job to establish
consistent and relevant physical parameter values for a case.
The guitar string example illustrates the point.
However, by *scaling*
the mathematical problem we can often reduce the need to estimate
physical parameters dramatically. The scaling technique
consists of introducing new
independent and dependent variables, with the aim that the absolute
value of these is not very large or small, but preferably around unity
in size. We introduce the dimensionless variables

.. math::
         \bar x = \frac{x}{L},\quad \bar t = \frac{c}{L}t,\quad
        \bar u = \frac{u}{a}
        \tp
        

Here, :math:`L` is a typical length scale, e.g., the length of the domain,
and :math:`a` is a typical size of :math:`u`, e.g., determined from the
initial condition: :math:`a=\max_x|I(x)|`.

Inserting these new variables in the PDE and noting that

.. math::
         \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{aL}{c}\frac{\partial\bar u}{\partial\bar t},

by the chain rule, one gets

.. math::
         \frac{a^2L^2}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2\bar u}{\partial\bar t^2}
        = \frac{a^2c^2}{L^2}\frac{\partial^2\bar u}{\partial\bar x^2},

in case :math:`f=0`.
Dropping the bars, we arrive at the scaled PDE

.. _Eq:_auto38:

.. math::

    \tag{114}
    \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2},
        
        

which has not parameter :math:`c^2` anymore. The initial conditions are scaled
as

.. math::
         a\bar u(\bar x, 0) = I(L\bar x)

and

.. math::
         \frac{a}{L/c}\frac{\partial\bar u}{\partial\bar t}(\bar x,0) = V(L\bar x),

resulting in

.. math::
         \bar u(\bar x, 0) = \frac{I(L\bar x)}{\max_x |I(x)|},\quad
        \frac{\partial\bar u}{\partial\bar t}(\bar x,0) = \frac{L}{ac}V(L\bar x)\tp

In the common case :math:`V=0` we see that there are no physical parameters to be
estimated in the PDE model!

If we have a program implemented for the physical wave equation with
dimensions, we can obtain the dimensionless, scaled version by
setting :math:`c=1`. The initial condition of a guitar string,
given in :ref:`(113) <Eq:wave:pde1:guitar:I>`, gets its scaled form by choosing
:math:`a=1`, :math:`L=1`, and :math:`x_0\in [0,1]`. This means that we only need to
decide on the :math:`x_0` value as a fraction of unity, because
the scaled problem corresponds to setting all
other parameters to unity. In the code we can just set
``a=c=L=1``, ``x0=0.8``, and there is no need to calculate with
wavelengths and frequencies to estimate :math:`c`!

The only non-trivial parameter to estimate in the scaled problem
is the final end time of the simulation, or more precisely, how it relates
to periods in periodic solutions in time, since we often want to
express the end time as a certain number of periods.
The period in the dimensionless problem is 2, so the end time can be
set to the desired number of periods times 2.

Why the dimensionless period is 2 can be explained by the following
reasoning.
Suppose as :math:`u` behaves as :math:`\cos (\omega t)` in time in variables
with dimension. The corresponding period is then :math:`P=2\pi/\omega`, but
we need to estimate :math:`\omega`. A typical solution of the wave
equation is :math:`u(x,t)=A\cos(kx)\cos(\omega t)`, where :math:`A` is an amplitude
and :math:`k` is related to the wave length :math:`\lambda` in space: :math:`\lambda = 2\pi/k`.
Both :math:`\lambda` and :math:`A` will be given by the initial condition :math:`I(x)`.
Inserting this :math:`u(x,t)` in the PDE yields :math:`-\omega^2 = -c^2k^2`, i.e.,
:math:`\omega = kc`. The period is therefore :math:`P=2\pi/(kc)`.
If the boundary conditions are :math:`u(0,t)=u(0,L)`, we need to have
:math:`kL = n\pi` for integer :math:`n`. The period becomes :math:`P=2L/nc`. The longest
period is :math:`P=2L/c`. The dimensionless period is :math:`\tilde P` is obtained
by dividing :math:`P` by the time scale :math:`L/c`, which results in :math:`\tilde P=2`.
Shorter waves in the initial condition will have a dimensionless
shorter period :math:`\tilde P=2/n` (:math:`n>1`).

Vectorization
=============

.. index:: vectorization

The computational algorithm for solving the wave equation visits one
mesh point at a time and evaluates a formula for the new value :math:`u_i^{n+1}`
at
that point. Technically, this is implemented by a loop over array
elements in a program. Such loops may run slowly in Python (and
similar interpreted languages such as R and MATLAB).
One technique for speeding up loops is to
perform operations on entire arrays instead of working with one element
at a time. This is referred to as *vectorization*, *vector computing*,
or *array computing*.
Operations on whole arrays are possible if the computations
involving each element is independent of each other and therefore can,
at least in principle, be performed simultaneously.
Vectorization not only speeds up the code on serial computers, but
also makes it easy to exploit parallel computing.

.. _wave:pde1:impl:vec:slices:basics:

Operations on slices of arrays
------------------------------

.. index:: scalar code

.. index:: vectorization

.. index:: array computing

.. index:: array slices

.. index:: slice

Efficient computing with ``numpy`` arrays demands that we avoid loops
and compute with entire arrays at once (or at least large portions of them).
Consider this calculation of differences :math:`d_i = u_{i+1}-u_i`:

.. code-block:: python

        n = u.size
        for i in range(0, n-1):
            d[i] = u[i+1] - u[i]

All the differences here are independent of each other.
The computation of ``d`` can therefore alternatively be done by
subtracting the array :math:`(u_0,u_1,\ldots,u_{n-1})` from
the array where the elements are shifted one index upwards:
:math:`(u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_n)`, see Figure :ref:`wave:pde1:vec:fig1`.
The former subset of the array can be
expressed by ``u[0:n-1]``,
``u[0:-1]``, or just
``u[:-1]``, meaning from index 0 up to,
but not including, the last element (``-1``). The latter subset
is obtained by ``u[1:n]`` or ``u[1:]``,
meaning from index 1 and the rest of the array.
The computation of ``d`` can now be done without an explicit Python loop:

.. code-block:: python

        d = u[1:] - u[:-1]

or with explicit limits if desired:

.. code-block:: python

        d = u[1:n] - u[0:n-1]

Indices with a colon, going from an index to (but not including) another
index are called *slices*. With ``numpy`` arrays, the computations
are still done by loops, but in efficient, compiled, highly optimized
C or Fortran code. Such loops are sometimes referred to as *vectorized
loops*. Such loops can also easily be distributed
among many processors on parallel computers. We say that the *scalar code*
above, working on an element (a scalar) at a time, has been replaced by
an equivalent *vectorized code*. The process of vectorizing code is called
*vectorization*.

   *Illustration of subtracting two slices of two arrays*


.. admonition:: Test your understanding

   Newcomers to vectorization are encouraged to choose
   a small array ``u``, say with five elements,
   and simulate with pen and paper
   both the loop version and the vectorized version above.




Finite difference schemes basically contain differences between array
elements with shifted indices. As an example,
consider the updating formula

.. code-block:: python

        for i in range(1, n-1):
            u2[i] = u[i-1] - 2*u[i] + u[i+1]

The vectorization consists of replacing the loop by arithmetics on
slices of arrays of length ``n-2``:

.. code-block:: python

        u2 = u[:-2] - 2*u[1:-1] + u[2:]
        u2 = u[0:n-2] - 2*u[1:n-1] + u[2:n]   # alternative

Note that the length of ``u2`` becomes ``n-2``. If ``u2`` is already an array of
length ``n`` and we want to use the formula to update all the "inner"
elements of ``u2``, as we will when solving a 1D wave equation, we can write

.. code-block:: python

        u2[1:-1]  = u[:-2] - 2*u[1:-1] + u[2:]
        u2[1:n-1] = u[0:n-2] - 2*u[1:n-1] + u[2:n]   # alternative

The first expression's right-hand side is realized by the
following steps, involving temporary arrays with intermediate results,
since each array operation can only involve one or two arrays.
The ``numpy`` package performs the first line above in
four steps:

.. code-block:: text

        temp1 = 2*u[1:-1]
        temp2 = u[:-2] - temp1
        temp3 = temp2 + u[2:]
        u2[1:-1] = temp3

We need three temporary arrays, but a user does not need to worry about
such temporary arrays.


.. admonition:: Common mistakes with array slices

   Array expressions with slices demand that the slices have the same
   shape. It easy to make a mistake in, e.g.,
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           u2[1:n-1] = u[0:n-2] - 2*u[1:n-1] + u[2:n]
   
   and write
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           u2[1:n-1] = u[0:n-2] - 2*u[1:n-1] + u[1:n]
   
   Now ``u[1:n]`` has wrong length (``n-1``) compared to the other array
   slices, causing a ``ValueError`` and the message
   ``could not broadcast input array from shape 103 into shape 104``
   (if ``n`` is 105). When such errors occur one must closely examine
   all the slices. Usually, it is easier to get upper limits of slices
   right when they use ``-1`` or ``-2`` or empty limit rather than
   expressions involving the length.
   
   Another common mistake is to forget the slice in the array on the
   left-hand side,
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           u2 = u[0:n-2] - 2*u[1:n-1] + u[1:n]
   
   This is really crucial: now ``u2`` becomes a *new* array of length
   ``n-2``, which is the wrong length as we have no entries for the boundary
   values. We meant to insert the right-hand side array *into* the
   in the original ``u2`` array for the entries that correspond to the
   internal points in the mesh (``1:n-1`` or ``1:-1``).




Vectorization may also work nicely with functions. To illustrate, we may
extend the previous example as follows:

.. code-block:: python

        def f(x):
            return x**2 + 1
        
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            u2[i] = u[i-1] - 2*u[i] + u[i+1] + f(x[i])

Assuming ``u2``, ``u``, and ``x`` all have length ``n``, the vectorized
version becomes

.. code-block:: python

        u2[1:-1] = u[:-2] - 2*u[1:-1] + u[2:] + f(x[1:-1])

Obviously, ``f`` must be able to take an array as argument for ``f[x[1:-1])``
to make sense.

.. _wave:pde1:impl:vec:slices:fdm:

Finite difference schemes expressed as slices
---------------------------------------------

We now have the necessary tools to vectorize the wave equation
algorithm as described mathematically in the section :ref:`wave:string:alg`
and through code in the section :ref:`wave:pde1:impl:solver`.  There are
three loops: one for the initial condition, one for the first time
step, and finally the loop that is repeated for all subsequent time
levels. Since only the latter is repeated a potentially large number
of times, we limit our vectorization efforts to this loop:

.. code-block:: python

        for i in range(1, Nx):
            u[i] = 2*u_1[i] - u_2[i] + \ 
                   C2*(u_1[i-1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[i+1])

The vectorized version becomes

.. code-block:: python

        u[1:-1] = - u_2[1:-1] + 2*u_1[1:-1] + \ 
                  C2*(u_1[:-2] - 2*u_1[1:-1] + u_1[2:])

or

.. code-block:: python

        u[1:Nx] = 2*u_1[1:Nx]- u_2[1:Nx] + \ 
                  C2*(u_1[0:Nx-1] - 2*u_1[1:Nx] + u_1[2:Nx+1])

.. We may vectorize the other loops regarding the initial condition and

.. the first time step, but the effect will hardly be

.. noticeable in long time simulations.

The program
`wave1D_u0v.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave1D/wave1D_u0v.py>`__
contains a new version of the function ``solver`` where both the scalar
and the vectorized loops are included (the argument ``version`` is
set to ``scalar`` or ``vectorized``, respectively).

We may reuse the quadratic solution :math:`\uex(x,t)=x(L-x)(1+{\half}t)` for
verifying also the vectorized code. A test function can now verify
both the scalar and the vectorized version. Moreover, we may
use a ``user_action`` function that compares the computed and exact
solution at each time level and performs a test:

.. admonition:: Lambda functions

   The code segment above demonstrates how to achieve very
   compact code, without degraded readability,
   by use of lambda functions for the various
   input parameters that require a Python function. In essence,
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           f = lambda x, t: L*(x-t)**2
   
   is equivalent to
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           def f(x, t):
               return L(x-t)**2
   
   Note that lambda functions can just contain a single expression and no
   statements.
   
   One advantage with lambda functions is that they can be used directly
   in calls:
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           solver(I=lambda x: sin(pi*x/L), V=0, f=0, ...)




Efficiency measurements
-----------------------

The ``wave1D_u0v.py`` contains our new ``solver`` function with both
scalar and vectorized code. For comparing the efficiency
of scalar versus vectorized code, we need a ``viz`` function
as discussed in the section :ref:`wave:pde1:impl:animate`.
All of this ``viz`` function can be reused, except the call
to ``solver_function``. This call lacks the parameter
``version``, which we want to set to ``vectorized`` and ``scalar``
for our efficiency measurements.

One solution is to copy the ``viz`` code from ``wave1D_u0`` into
``wave1D_u0v.py`` and add a ``version`` argument to the ``solver_function`` call.
Taking into account how much quite complicated animation code we
then duplicate, this is not a good idea.
Introducing the ``version`` argument in ``wave1D_u0.viz`` is not
a good solution since ``version`` has no meaning in that file.

Solution 1
~~~~~~~~~~

Calling ``viz`` in ``wave1D_u0`` with ``solver_function`` as our new
solver in ``wave1D_u0v`` works fine, since this solver has
``version='vectorized'`` as default value. The problem arises when we
want to test ``version='vectorized'``. The simplest solution is then
to use ``wave1D_u0.solver`` instead. We make a new ``viz`` function
in ``wave1D_u0v.py`` that has a ``version`` argument and that just
calls ``wave1D_u0.viz``:

.. code-block:: python

        def viz(
            I, V, f, c, L, dt, C, T,  # PDE paramteres
            umin, umax,               # Interval for u in plots
            animate=True,             # Simulation with animation?
            tool='matplotlib',        # 'matplotlib' or 'scitools'
            solver_function=solver,   # Function with numerical algorithm
            version='vectorized',     # 'scalar' or 'vectorized'
            ):
            import wave1D_u0
            if version == 'vectorized':
                # Reuse viz from wave1D_u0, but with the present
                # modules' new vectorized solver (which has
                # version='vectorized' as default argument;
                # wave1D_u0.viz does not feature this argument)
                cpu = wave1D_u0.viz(
                    I, V, f, c, L, dt, C, T, umin, umax,
                    animate, tool, solver_function=solver)
            elif version == 'scalar':
                # Call wave1D_u0.viz with a solver with
                # scalar code and use wave1D_u0.solver.
                cpu = wave1D_u0.viz(
                    I, V, f, c, L, dt, C, T, umin, umax,
                    animate, tool,
                    solver_function=wave1D_u0.solver)

Solution 2
~~~~~~~~~~

There is a more advanced, fancier solution featuring a very useful trick:
we can make a new function that will always call ``wave1D_u0v.solver``
with ``version='scalar'``. The ``functools.partial`` function from
standard Python takes a function ``func`` as argument and
a series of positional and keyword arguments and returns a
new function that will call ``func`` with the supplied arguments,
while the user can control all the other arguments in ``func``.
Consider a trivial example,

.. code-block:: python

        def f(a, b, c=2):
            return a + b + c

We want to ensure that ``f`` is always called with ``c=3``, i.e., ``f``
has only two "free" arguments ``a`` and ``b``.
This functionality is obtained by

.. code-block:: python

        import functools
        f2 = functools.partial(f, c=3)
        
        print f2(1, 2)  # results in 1+2+3=6

Now ``f2`` calls ``f`` with whatever the user supplies as ``a`` and ``b``,
but ``c`` is always ``3``.

Back to our ``viz`` code, we can do

.. code-block:: python

        import functools
        # Call scalar with version fixed to `scalar`
        scalar_solver = functools.partial(scalar, version='scalar')
        cpu = wave1D_u0.viz(
                I, V, f, c, L, dt, C, T, umin, umax,
                animate, tool, solver_function=scalar_solver)

The new ``scalar_solver`` takes the same arguments as
``wave1D_u0.scalar`` and calls ``wave1D_u0v.scalar``,
but always supplies the extra argument
``version='scalar'``. When sending this ``solver_function``
to ``wave1D_u0.viz``, the latter will call ``wave1D_u0v.solver``
with all the ``I``, ``V``, ``f``, etc., arguments we supply, plus
``version='scalar'``.

Efficiency experiments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We now have a ``viz`` function that can call our solver function both in
scalar and vectorized mode. The function ``run_efficiency_experiments``
in ``wave1D_u0v.py`` performs a set of experiments and reports the
CPU time spent in the scalar and vectorized solver for
the previous string vibration example with spatial mesh resolutions
:math:`N_x=50,100,200,400,800`. Running this function reveals
that the vectorized
code runs substantially faster: the vectorized code runs approximately
:math:`N_x/10` times as fast as the scalar code!

.. _wave:pde1:impl:ref:switch:

Remark on the updating of arrays
--------------------------------

At the end of each time step we need to update the ``u_2`` and ``u_1``
arrays such that they have the right content for the next time step:

.. code-block:: python

        u_2[:] = u_1
        u_1[:] = u

The order here is important! (Updating ``u_1`` first, makes ``u_2`` equal
to ``u``, which is wrong.)

The assignment ``u_1[:] = u`` copies the content of the ``u`` array into
the elements of the ``u_1`` array. Such copying takes time, but
that time is negligible compared to the time needed for
computing ``u`` from the finite difference formula,
even when the formula has a vectorized implementation.
However, efficiency of program code is a key topic when solving
PDEs numerically (particularly when there are two or three
space dimensions), so it must be mentioned that there exists a
much more efficient way of making the arrays ``u_2`` and ``u_1``
ready for the next time step. The idea is based on *switching
references* and explained as follows.

A Python variable is actually a reference to some object (C programmers
may think of pointers). Instead of copying data, we can let ``u_2``
refer to the ``u_1`` object and ``u_1`` refer to the ``u`` object.
This is a very efficiency operation (like switching pointers in C).
A naive implementation like

.. code-block:: python

        u_2 = u_1
        u_1 = u

will fail, however, because now ``u_2`` refers to the ``u_1`` object,
but then the name ``u_1`` refers to ``u``, so that this ``u`` object
has two references, ``u_1`` and ``u``, while our third array, originally
referred to by ``u_2`` has no more references and is lost.
This means that the variables ``u``, ``u_1``, and ``u_2`` refer to two
arrays and not three. Consequently, the computations at the next
time level will be messed up since updating the elements in
``u`` will imply updating the elements in ``u_1`` too so the solution
at the previous time step, which is crucial in our formulas, is
destroyed.

While ``u_2 = u_1`` is fine, ``u_1 = u`` is problematic, so
the solution to this problem is to ensure that ``u``
points to the ``u_2`` array. This is mathematically wrong, but
new correct values will be filled into ``u`` at the next time step
and make it right.

The correct switch of references is

.. code-block:: python

        tmp = u_2
        u_2 = u_1
        u_1 = u
        u = tmp

We can get rid of the temporary reference ``tmp`` by writing

.. code-block:: python

        u_2, u_1, u = u_1, u, u_2

This switching of references for updating our arrays
will be used in later implementations.


.. admonition:: Caution

   The update ``u_2, u_1, u = u_1, u, u_2`` leaves wrong content in ``u``
   at the final time step. This means that if we return ``u``, as we
   do in the example codes here, we actually return ``u_2``, which is
   obviously wrong. It is therefore important to adjust the content
   of ``u`` to ``u = u_1`` before returning ``u``.

Exercise 18: Simulate a standing wave
-------------------------------------

The purpose of this exercise is to simulate standing waves on :math:`[0,L]`
and illustrate the error in the simulation.
Standing waves arise from an initial condition

.. math::
         u(x,0)= A \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{L}mx\right),

where :math:`m` is an integer and :math:`A` is a freely chosen amplitude.
The corresponding exact solution can be computed and reads

.. math::
         \uex(x,t) =  A\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{L}mx\right)
        \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{L}mct\right)\tp
        

**a)**
Explain that for a function :math:`\sin kx\cos \omega t` the wave length
in space is :math:`\lambda = 2\pi /k` and the period in time is :math:`P=2\pi/\omega`.
Use these expressions to find the wave length in space and period in
time of :math:`\uex` above.

**b)**
Import the ``solver`` function ``wave1D_u0.py`` into a new file
where the ``viz`` function is reimplemented such that it
plots either the numerical *and* the exact solution, *or* the error.

**c)**
Make animations where you illustrate how the error
:math:`e^n_i =\uex(x_i, t_n)- u^n_i`
develops and increases in time. Also make animations of
:math:`u` and :math:`\uex` simultaneously.

Exercise 19: Add storage of solution in a user action function
--------------------------------------------------------------

Extend the ``plot_u`` function in the file ``wave1D_u0.py`` to also store
the solutions ``u`` in a list.
To this end, declare ``all_u`` as
an empty list in the ``viz`` function, outside ``plot_u``, and perform
an append operation inside the ``plot_u`` function. Note that a
function, like ``plot_u``, inside another function, like ``viz``,
remembers all local variables in ``viz`` function, including ``all_u``,
even when ``plot_u`` is called (as ``user_action``) in the ``solver`` function.
Test both ``all_u.append(u)`` and ``all_u.append(u.copy())``.
Why does one of these constructions fail to store the solution correctly?
Let the ``viz`` function return the ``all_u`` list
converted to a two-dimensional ``numpy`` array.

Exercise 21: Compare several Courant numbers in one movie
---------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this exercise is to make movies where several curves,
corresponding to different Courant numbers, are visualized.
Import the ``solver`` function from the ``wave1D_u0_s`` movie
in a new file ``wave_compare.py``. Reimplement the ``viz`` function
such that it can take a list of ``C`` values as argument
and create a movie with solutions corresponding to the given ``C``
values. The ``plot_u`` function must be changed to store the solution
in an array (see :ref:`wave:exer:store:list` or
:ref:`wave:exer:store:list:class` for details), ``solver`` must be
computed for each value of the Courant number, and finally
one must run through each time step and plot all the spatial
solution curves in one figure and store it in a file.

The challenge in such a visualization is to ensure that the curves in
one plot corresponds to the same time point. The easiest remedy is to
keep the time and space resolution constant and change the wave
velocity :math:`c` to change the Courant number.

Project 22: Calculus with 1D mesh functions
-------------------------------------------

This project explores integration and differentiation of
mesh functions, both with scalar and vectorized implementations.
We are given a mesh function :math:`f_i` on a spatial one-dimensional
mesh :math:`x_i=i\Delta x`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x`, over the interval :math:`[a,b]`.

**a)**
Define the discrete derivative of :math:`f_i` by using centered
differences at internal mesh points and one-sided differences
at the end points. Implement a scalar version of
the computation in a Python function and write an associated unit test
for the linear case :math:`f(x)=4x-2.5` where the discrete derivative should
be exact.

**b)**
Vectorize the implementation of the discrete derivative.
Extend the unit test to check the validity of the implementation.

**c)**
To compute the discrete integral :math:`F_i` of :math:`f_i`, we assume that
the mesh function :math:`f_i` varies linearly between the mesh points.
Let :math:`f(x)` be such a linear interpolant of :math:`f_i`. We then
have

.. math::
         F_i = \int_{x_0}^{x_i} f(x) dx\tp

The exact integral of a piecewise linear function :math:`f(x)` is
given by the Trapezoidal rule. S
how that if :math:`F_{i}` is already computed, we can find :math:`F_{i+1}`
from

.. math::
         F_{i+1} = F_i + \half(f_i + f_{i+1})\Delta x\tp

Make a function for the scalar implementation of the discrete integral
as a mesh function. That is, the function should return
:math:`F_i` for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x`.
For a unit test one can use the fact that the above defined
discrete integral of a linear
function (say :math:`f(x)=4x-2.5`) is exact.

**d)**
Vectorize the implementation of the discrete integral.
Extend the unit test to check the validity of the implementation.

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
Interpret the recursive formula for :math:`F_{i+1}` as a sum.
Make an array with each element of the sum and use the "cumsum"
(``numpy.cumsum``) operation to compute the accumulative sum:
``numpy.cumsum([1,3,5])`` is ``[1,4,9]``.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

**e)**
Create a class ``MeshCalculus`` that can integrate and differentiate
mesh functions. The class can just define some methods that call
the previously implemented Python functions. Here is an example
on the usage:

.. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        calc = MeshCalculus(vectorized=True)
        x = np.linspace(0, 1, 11)        # mesh
        f = np.exp(x)                    # mesh function

.. _wave:pde2:Neumann:

Generalization: reflecting boundaries
=====================================

The boundary condition :math:`u=0` in a wave equation
reflects the wave, but :math:`u` changes sign at the boundary,
while the condition :math:`u_x=0` reflects the wave as a mirror and preserves
the sign, see
a `web page <http://tinyurl.com/opdfafk/pub/mov-wave/demo_BC_gaussian/index.html>`__
or a `movie file <http://tinyurl.com/opdfafk/pub/mov-wave/demo_BC_gaussian/movie.flv>`__
for demonstration.

Our next task is to explain how to implement the boundary
condition :math:`u_x=0`, which is
more complicated to express numerically and also to implement than
a given value of :math:`u`.
We shall present two methods for implementing :math:`u_x=0`
in a finite difference scheme, one based on deriving a modified
stencil at the boundary, and another one based on extending the mesh
with ghost cells and ghost points.

   that specify the value of :math:`\partial u/\partial n`,

scheme, it is tempting to implement :ref:`(115) <Eq:wave:pde1:Neumann:0>` at
:math:`x=0` and :math:`t=t_n` by the difference

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:Neumann:0:cd:

.. math::

    \tag{116}
    [D_{2x} u]^n_0 = \frac{u_{-1}^n - u_1^n}{2\Delta x} = 0
        \tp
        
        

The problem is that :math:`u_{-1}^n` is not a :math:`u` value that is being
computed since the point is outside the mesh. However, if we combine
:ref:`(116) <Eq:wave:pde1:Neumann:0:cd>` with the scheme

.. :ref:`(94) <Eq:wave:pde1:step4>`

for :math:`i=0`,

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:Neumann:0:scheme:

.. math::

    \tag{117}
    u^{n+1}_i = -u^{n-1}_i + 2u^n_i + C^2
        \left(u^{n}_{i+1}-2u^{n}_{i} + u^{n}_{i-1}\right),
        
        

we can eliminate the fictitious value :math:`u_{-1}^n`. We see that
:math:`u_{-1}^n=u_1^n` from :ref:`(116) <Eq:wave:pde1:Neumann:0:cd>`, which
can be used in :ref:`(117) <Eq:wave:pde1:Neumann:0:scheme>` to
arrive at a modified scheme for the boundary point :math:`u_0^{n+1}`:

.. _Eq:_auto39:

.. math::

    \tag{118}
    u^{n+1}_i = -u^{n-1}_i  + 2u^n_i + 2C^2
        \left(u^{n}_{i+1}-u^{n}_{i}\right),\quad i=0 \tp   
        

Figure :ref:`wave:pde1:fig:Neumann:stencil` visualizes this equation
for computing :math:`u^3_0` in terms of :math:`u^2_0`, :math:`u^1_0`, and
:math:`u^2_1`.

   *Modified stencil at a boundary with a Neumann condition*

Similarly, :ref:`(115) <Eq:wave:pde1:Neumann:0>` applied at :math:`x=L`
is discretized by a central difference

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:Neumann:0:cd2:

.. math::

    \tag{119}
    \frac{u_{N_x+1}^n - u_{N_x-1}^n}{2\Delta x} = 0
        \tp
        
        

Combined with the scheme for :math:`i=N_x` we get a modified scheme for
the boundary value :math:`u_{N_x}^{n+1}`:

.. _Eq:_auto40:

.. math::

    \tag{120}
    u^{n+1}_i = -u^{n-1}_i + 2u^n_i + 2C^2
        \left(u^{n}_{i-1}-u^{n}_{i}\right),\quad i=N_x \tp   
        

The modification of the scheme at the boundary is also required for
the special formula for the first time step. How the stencil moves
through the mesh and is modified at the boundary can be illustrated
by an animation
in a `web page <http://tinyurl.com/opdfafk/pub/mov-wave/wave1D_PDE_Neumann_stencil_gpl/index.html>`__
or a `movie file <http://tinyurl.com/opdfafk/pub/mov-wave/wave1D_PDE_Neumann_stencil_gpl/movie.ogg>`__.

.. _wave:pde2:Neumann:impl:

Implementation of Neumann conditions
------------------------------------

We have seen in the preceding section
that the special formulas for the boundary points
arise from replacing :math:`u_{i-1}^n` by :math:`u_{i+1}^n` when computing
:math:`u_i^{n+1}` from the stencil formula for :math:`i=0`. Similarly, we
replace :math:`u_{i+1}^n` by :math:`u_{i-1}^n` in the stencil formula
for :math:`i=N_x`. This observation can conveniently
be used in the coding: we just work with the general stencil formula,
but write the code such that it is easy to replace ``u[i-1]`` by
``u[i+1]`` and vice versa. This is achieved by
having the indices ``i+1`` and ``i-1`` as variables ``ip1`` (``i`` plus 1)
and ``im1`` (``i`` minus 1), respectively.
At the boundary we can easily define ``im1=i+1`` while we use
``im1=i-1`` in the internal parts of the mesh. Here are the details
of the implementation (note that the updating formula for ``u[i]``
is the general stencil formula):

.. code-block:: python

        i = 0
        ip1 = i+1
        im1 = ip1  # i-1 -> i+1
        u[i] = u_1[i] + C2*(u_1[im1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[ip1])
        
        i = Nx
        im1 = i-1
        ip1 = im1  # i+1 -> i-1
        u[i] = u_1[i] + C2*(u_1[im1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[ip1])

We can in fact create one loop over both the internal and boundary
points and use only one updating formula:

.. code-block:: python

        for i in range(0, Nx+1):
            ip1 = i+1 if i < Nx else i-1
            im1 = i-1 if i > 0  else i+1
            u[i] = u_1[i] + C2*(u_1[im1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[ip1])

The program `wave1D_n0.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave1D/wave1D_n0.py>`__
contains a complete implementation of the 1D wave equation with
boundary conditions :math:`u_x = 0` at :math:`x=0` and :math:`x=L`.

It would be nice to modify the ``test_quadratic`` test case from the
``wave1D_u0.py`` with Dirichlet conditions, described in the section :ref:`wave:pde1:impl:vec:verify:quadratic`. However, the Neumann
conditions requires the polynomial variation in :math:`x` direction to
be of third degree, which causes challenging problems when
designing a test where the numerical solution is known exactly.
:ref:`wave:fd2:exer:verify:cubic` outlines ideas and code
for this purpose. The only test in ``wave1D_n0.py`` is to start
with a plug wave at rest and see that the initial condition is
reached again perfectly after one period of motion, but such
a test requires :math:`C=1` (so the numerical solution coincides with
the exact solution of the PDE, see the section :ref:`wave:pde1:num:dispersion`).

.. _wave:indexset:

Index set notation
------------------

.. index:: index set notation

To improve our mathematical writing and our implementations,
it is wise to introduce a special notation for index sets. This means
that we write
:math:`x_i`, :math:`i\in\Ix`, instead of :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x`.
Obviously, :math:`\Ix` must be the index set :math:`\Ix =\{0,\ldots,N_x\}`, but it
is often advantageous to have a symbol for this set rather than
specifying all its elements (all the time, as we have done up to
now). This new notation saves writing and makes
specifications of algorithms and their implementation of computer code
simpler.

The first index in the set will be denoted :math:`\setb{\Ix}`
and the last :math:`\sete{\Ix}`. When we need to skip the first element of
the set, we use :math:`\setr{\Ix}` for the remaining subset
:math:`\setr{\Ix}=\{1,\ldots,N_x\}`. Similarly, if the last element is
to be dropped, we write :math:`\setl{\Ix}=\{0,\ldots,N_x-1\}` for the
remaining indices.
All the
indices corresponding to inner grid points are specified by
:math:`\seti{\Ix}=\{1,\ldots,N_x-1\}`.  For the time domain we find it
natural to explicitly use 0 as the first index, so we will usually
write :math:`n=0` and :math:`t_0` rather than :math:`n=\It^0`. We also avoid notation
like :math:`x_{\sete{\Ix}}` and will instead use :math:`x_i`, :math:`i=\sete{\Ix}`.

The Python code associated with index sets applies the following
conventions:

==================  ============  
     Notation          Python     
==================  ============  
:math:`\Ix`         ``Ix``        
:math:`\setb{\Ix}`  ``Ix[0]``     
:math:`\sete{\Ix}`  ``Ix[-1]``    
:math:`\setl{\Ix}`  ``Ix[:-1]``   
:math:`\setr{\Ix}`  ``Ix[1:]``    
:math:`\seti{\Ix}`  ``Ix[1:-1]``  
==================  ============  


.. admonition:: Why index sets are useful

   An important feature of the index set notation is that it
   keeps our formulas and code independent of how
   we count mesh points. For example, the notation :math:`i\in\Ix` or :math:`i=\setb{\Ix}`
   remains the same whether :math:`\Ix` is defined as above or as starting at 1,
   i.e., :math:`\Ix=\{1,\ldots,Q\}`. Similarly, we can in the code define
   ``Ix=range(Nx+1)`` or ``Ix=range(1,Q)``, and expressions
   like ``Ix[0]`` and ``Ix[1:-1]`` remain correct. One application where
   the index set notation is convenient is
   conversion of code from a language where arrays has base index 0 (e.g.,
   Python and C) to languages where the base index is 1 (e.g., MATLAB and
   Fortran). Another important application is implementation of
   Neumann conditions via ghost points (see next section).




For the current problem setting in the :math:`x,t` plane, we work with
the index sets

.. _Eq:_auto41:

.. math::

    \tag{121}
    \Ix = \{0,\ldots,N_x\},\quad \It = \{0,\ldots,N_t\},
        
        

defined in Python as

.. code-block:: python

        Ix = range(0, Nx+1)
        It = range(0, Nt+1)

A finite difference scheme can with the index set notation be specified as

.. math::
        
        u_i^{n+1} &= u^n_i - \half
        C^2\left(u^{n}_{i+1}-2u^{n}_{i} + u^{n}_{i-1}\right),\quad,
        i\in\seti{\Ix},\ n=0,\\ 
        u^{n+1}_i &= -u^{n-1}_i  + 2u^n_i + C^2
        \left(u^{n}_{i+1}-2u^{n}_{i}+u^{n}_{i-1}\right),
        \quad i\in\seti{\Ix},\ n\in\seti{\It},\\ 
        u_i^{n+1} &= 0,
        \quad i=\setb{\Ix},\ n\in\setl{\It},\\ 
        u_i^{n+1} &= 0,
        \quad i=\sete{\Ix},\ n\in\setl{\It}\tp
        

The corresponding implementation becomes

.. code-block:: python

        # Initial condition
        for i in Ix[1:-1]:
            u[i] = u_1[i] - 0.5*C2*(u_1[i-1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[i+1])
        
        # Time loop
        for n in It[1:-1]:
            # Compute internal points
            for i in Ix[1:-1]:
                u[i] = - u_2[i] + 2*u_1[i] + \ 
                       C2*(u_1[i-1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[i+1])
            # Compute boundary conditions
            i = Ix[0];  u[i] = 0
            i = Ix[-1]; u[i] = 0


.. note::
   The program `wave1D_dn.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave1D/wave1D_dn.py>`__
   applies the index set notation and
   solves the 1D wave equation :math:`u_{tt}=c^2u_{xx}+f(x,t)` with
   quite general boundary and initial conditions:
   
     * :math:`x=0`: :math:`u=U_0(t)` or :math:`u_x=0`
   
     * :math:`x=L`: :math:`u=U_L(t)` or :math:`u_x=0`
   
     * :math:`t=0`: :math:`u=I(x)`
   
     * :math:`t=0`: :math:`u_t=I(x)`
   
   The program combines Dirichlet and Neumann conditions, scalar and vectorized
   implementation of schemes, and the index notation into one piece of code.
   A lot of test examples are also included in the program:
   
    * A rectangular plug-shaped initial condition. (For :math:`C=1` the solution
      will be a rectangle that jumps one cell per time step, making the case
      well suited for verification.)
   
    * A Gaussian function as initial condition.
   
    * A triangular profile as initial condition, which resembles the
      typical initial shape of a guitar string.
   
    * A sinusoidal variation of :math:`u` at :math:`x=0` and either :math:`u=0` or
      :math:`u_x=0` at :math:`x=L`.
   
    * An exact analytical solution :math:`u(x,t)=\cos(m\pi t/L)\sin({\half}m\pi x/L)`, which can be used for convergence rate tests.

.. _wave:pde1:verify:

Verifying the implementation of Neumann conditions
--------------------------------------------------

How can we test that the Neumann conditions are correctly implemented?
The ``solver`` function in the ``wave1D_dn.py`` program described in the
box above accepts Dirichlet and Neumann conditions at :math:`x=0` and :math:`x=L`.
It is tempting to apply a quadratic solution as described in
the sections :ref:`wave:pde2:fd` and :ref:`wave:pde1:impl:verify:quadratic`,
but it turns out that this solution is no longer an exact solution
of the discrete equations if a Neumann condition is implemented on
the boundary. A linear solution does not help since we only have
homogeneous Neumann conditions in ``wave1D_dn.py``, and we are
consequently left with testing just a constant solution: :math:`u=\hbox{const}`.

.. code-block:: python

        def test_constant():
            """
            Check the scalar and vectorized versions work for
            a constant u(x,t). We simulate in [0, L] and apply

                           version='vectorized')
                    print U_0, U_L

The quadratic solution is very useful for testing though, but it requires
Dirichlet conditions at both ends.

Another test may utilize the fact that the approximation error vanishes
when the Courant number is unity. We can, for example, start with a
plug profile as initial condition, let this wave split into two plug waves,
one in each direction, and check that the two plug waves come back and
form the initial condition again after "one period" of the solution
process. Neumann conditions can be applied at both ends. A proper
test function reads

.. code-block:: python

        def test_plug():
            """Check that an initial plug is correct back after one period."""
            L = 1.0
            c = 0.5
            dt = (L/10)/c  # Nx=10
            I = lambda x: 0 if abs(x-L/2.0) > 0.1 else 1
        
            u_s, x, t, cpu = solver(
                I=I,
                V=None, f=None, c=0.5, U_0=None, U_L=None, L=L,
                dt=dt, C=1, T=4, user_action=None, version='scalar')
            u_v, x, t, cpu = solver(
                I=I,
                V=None, f=None, c=0.5, U_0=None, U_L=None, L=L,
                dt=dt, C=1, T=4, user_action=None, version='vectorized')
            tol = 1E-13
            diff = abs(u_s - u_v).max()
            assert diff < tol
            u_0 = np.array([I(x_) for x_ in x])
            diff = np.abs(u_s - u_0).max()
            assert diff < tol

Other tests must rely on an unknown approximation error, so effectively
we are left with tests on the convergence rate.

.. _wave:pde1:Neumann:ghost:

Alternative implementation via ghost cells
------------------------------------------

Idea
~~~~

Instead of modifying the scheme at the boundary, we can introduce
extra points outside the domain such that the fictitious values
:math:`u_{-1}^n` and :math:`u_{N_x+1}^n`
are defined in the mesh.
Adding the intervals :math:`[-\Delta x,0]` and :math:`[L, L+\Delta x]`,
often referred to as *ghost cells*, to the mesh gives us all the
needed mesh points, corresponding to :math:`i=-1,0,\ldots,N_x,N_x+1`.
The extra points :math:`i=-1` and :math:`i=N_x+1` are known as *ghost points*,
and values at these points, :math:`u_{-1}^n` and :math:`u_{N_x+1}^n`, are
called *ghost values*.

The important idea is
to ensure that we always have

.. math::
         u_{-1}^n = u_{1}^n\hbox{ and } u_{N_x+1}^n = u_{N_x-1}^n,

because then
the application of the standard scheme at a boundary point :math:`i=0` or :math:`i=N_x`
will be correct and guarantee that the solution is compatible with the
boundary condition :math:`u_x=0`.

Implementation          (5)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``u`` array now needs extra elements corresponding to the ghost
points. Two new point values are needed:

.. code-block:: python

        u   = zeros(Nx+3)

The arrays ``u_1`` and ``u_2`` must be defined accordingly.

Unfortunately, a major indexing problem arises with ghost cells.
The reason is that Python indices *must* start
at 0 and ``u[-1]`` will always mean the last element in ``u``.
This fact gives, apparently, a mismatch between the mathematical
indices :math:`i=-1,0,\ldots,N_x+1` and the Python indices running over
``u``: ``0,..,Nx+2``. One remedy is to change the mathematical indexing
of :math:`i` in the scheme and write

.. math::
         u^{n+1}_i = \cdots,\quad i=1,\ldots,N_x+1,

instead of :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x` as we have previously used. The ghost
points now correspond to :math:`i=0` and :math:`i=N_x+1`.
A better solution is to use the ideas of the section :ref:`wave:indexset`:
we hide the specific index value in an index set and operate with
inner and boundary points using the index set notation.

To this end, we define ``u`` with proper length and ``Ix`` to be the corresponding
indices for the real physical mesh points (:math:`1,2,\ldots,N_x+1`):

.. code-block:: python

        u = zeros(Nx+3)
        Ix = range(1, u.shape[0]-1)

That is, the boundary points have indices ``Ix[0]`` and ``Ix[-1]`` (as before).
We first update the solution at all physical mesh points (i.e., interior
points in the mesh):

.. code-block:: python

        for i in Ix:
            u[i] = - u_2[i] + 2*u_1[i] + \ 
                   C2*(u_1[i-1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[i+1])

The indexing becomes a bit more complicated when we call functions like
``V(x)`` and ``f(x, t)``, as we must remember that the appropriate
:math:`x` coordinate is given as ``x[i-Ix[0]]``:

.. code-block:: python

        for i in Ix:
            u[i] = u_1[i] + dt*V(x[i-Ix[0]]) + \ 
                   0.5*C2*(u_1[i-1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[i+1]) + \ 
                   0.5*dt2*f(x[i-Ix[0]], t[0])

It remains to update the solution at ghost points, i.e, ``u[0]``
and ``u[-1]`` (or ``u[Nx+2]``). For a boundary condition :math:`u_x=0`,
the ghost value must equal the value at the associated inner mesh
point. Computer code makes this statement precise:

.. code-block:: python

        i = Ix[0]          # x=0 boundary
        u[i-1] = u[i+1]
        i = Ix[-1]         # x=L boundary
        u[i+1] = u[i-1]

The physical solution to be plotted is now in ``u[1:-1]``, or
equivalently ``u[Ix[0]:Ix[-1]+1]``, so this slice is
the quantity to be returned from a solver function.
A complete implementation appears in the program
`wave1D_n0_ghost.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave1D/wave1D_n0_ghost.py>`__.


.. warning::
    We have to be careful with how the spatial and temporal mesh
    points are stored. Say we let ``x`` be the physical mesh points,
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
            x = linspace(0, L, Nx+1)
    
    "Standard coding" of the initial condition,

            for i in Ix:
                u_1[i] = I(x[i])
    
    becomes wrong, since ``u_1`` and ``x`` have different lengths and the index ``i``
    corresponds to two different mesh points. In fact, ``x[i]`` corresponds
    to ``u[1+i]``. A correct implementation is
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
            for i in Ix:
                u_1[i] = I(x[i-Ix[0]])
    
    Similarly, a source term usually coded as ``f(x[i], t[n])`` is incorrect
    if ``x`` is defined to be the physical points, so ``x[i]`` must be
    replaced by ``x[i-Ix[0]]``.
    
    An alternative remedy is to let ``x`` also cover the ghost points such that
    ``u[i]`` is the value at ``x[i]``.




The ghost cell is only added to the boundary where we have a Neumann
condition. Suppose we have a Dirichlet condition at :math:`x=L` and
a homogeneous Neumann condition at :math:`x=0`. One ghost cell :math:`[-\Delta x,0]`
is added to the mesh, so the index set for the physical points
becomes :math:`\{1,\ldots,N_x+1\}`. A relevant implementation
is

.. code-block:: python

        u = zeros(Nx+2)
        Ix = range(1, u.shape[0])
        ...
        for i in Ix[:-1]:
            u[i] = - u_2[i] + 2*u_1[i] + \ 
                   C2*(u_1[i-1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[i+1]) + \ 
                   dt2*f(x[i-Ix[0]], t[n])
        i = Ix[-1]
        u[i] = U_0       # set Dirichlet value
        i = Ix[0]
        u[i-1] = u[i+1]  # update ghost value

The physical solution to be plotted is now in ``u[1:]``
or (as always) ``u[Ix[0]:Ix[-1]+1]``.

Generalization: variable wave velocity
======================================

Our next generalization of the 1D wave equation :ref:`(81) <Eq:wave:pde1>` or
:ref:`(97) <Eq:wave:pde2>` is to allow for a variable wave velocity :math:`c`:
:math:`c=c(x)`, usually motivated by wave motion in a domain composed of
different physical media. When the media differ in physical properties
like density or porosity, the wave velocity :math:`c` is affected and
will depend on the position in space.
Figure :ref:`wave:pde1:fig:pulse1:two:media` shows a wave
propagating in one medium :math:`[0, 0.7]\cup [0.9,1]` with wave
velocity :math:`c_1` (left) before it enters a second medium :math:`(0.7,0.9)`
with wave velocity :math:`c_2` (right). When the wave passes the boundary
where :math:`c` jumps from :math:`c_1` to :math:`c_2`, a part of the wave is reflected back
into the first medium (the *reflected* wave), while one part is
transmitted through the second medium (the *transmitted* wave).

The model PDE with a variable coefficient
-----------------------------------------

Instead of working with the squared quantity :math:`c^2(x)`, we
shall for notational convenience introduce :math:`q(x) = c^2(x)`.
A 1D wave equation with variable wave velocity often takes the form

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:pde:

.. math::

    \tag{122}
    \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} =
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( q(x)
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right) + f(x,t)
        
        \tp
        

This is the most frequent form of a wave
equation with variable wave velocity,
but other forms also appear, see the section :ref:`wave:app:string`
and equation :ref:`(205) <Eq:wave:app:string:model2>`.

As usual, we sample :ref:`(122) <Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:pde>` at a mesh point,

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial^2 }{\partial t^2} u(x_i,t_n) =
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( q(x_i)
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x} u(x_i,t_n)\right) + f(x_i,t_n),
        

where the only new term to discretize is

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( q(x_i)
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x} u(x_i,t_n)\right) = \left[
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( q(x)
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)\right]^n_i
        \tp
        

.. _wave:pde2:var:c:ideas:

Discretizing the variable coefficient
-------------------------------------

The principal idea is to first discretize the outer derivative.
Define

.. math::
         \phi = q(x)
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial x},
        

and use a centered derivative around :math:`x=x_i` for the derivative of :math:`\phi`:

.. math::
        
        \left[\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial x}\right]^n_i
        \approx \frac{\phi_{i+\half} - \phi_{i-\half}}{\Delta x}
        = [D_x\phi]^n_i
        \tp
        

Then discretize

.. math::
        
        \phi_{i+\half}  = q_{i+\half}
        \left[\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right]^n_{i+\half}
        \approx q_{i+\half} \frac{u^n_{i+1} - u^n_{i}}{\Delta x}
        = [q D_x u]_{i+\half}^n
        \tp
        

Similarly,

.. math::
        
        \phi_{i-\half}  = q_{i-\half}
        \left[\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right]^n_{i-\half}
        \approx q_{i-\half} \frac{u^n_{i} - u^n_{i-1}}{\Delta x}
        = [q D_x u]_{i-\half}^n
        \tp
        

These intermediate results are now combined to

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:formula:

.. math::

    \tag{123}
    \left[
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( q(x)
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)\right]^n_i
        \approx \frac{1}{\Delta x^2}
        \left( q_{i+\half} \left({u^n_{i+1} - u^n_{i}}\right)
        - q_{i-\half} \left({u^n_{i} - u^n_{i-1}}\right)\right)
        
        \tp
        

With operator notation we can write the discretization as

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:formula:op:

.. math::

    \tag{124}
    \left[
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( q(x)
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)\right]^n_i
        \approx [D_xq D_x u]^n_i
        
        \tp
        


.. admonition:: Do not use the chain rule on the spatial derivative term

   Many are tempted to use the chain rule on the
   term :math:`\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( q(x)
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)`, but this is not a good idea
   when discretizing such a term.
   
   The term with a variable coefficient expresses the net flux
   :math:`qu_x` into a small volume (i.e., interval in 1D):
   
   .. math::
            \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( q(x)
           \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right) \approx
           \frac{1}{\Delta x}(q(x+\Delta x)u_x(x+\Delta x) - q(x)u_x(x))\tp
   
   Our discretization reflects this
   principle directly: :math:`qu_x` at the right end of the cell minus :math:`qu_x`
   at the left end, because this follows from the formula
   :ref:`(123) <Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:formula>` or :math:`[D_x(q D_x u)]^n_i`.
   
   When using the chain rule, we get two
   terms :math:`qu_{xx} + q_xu_x`. The typical discretization is
   
   .. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:chainrule_scheme:

.. math::

    \tag{125}
    qD_xD_x u + D_{2x}q D_{2x} u]_i^n,
           
           
   
   Writing this out shows that it is different from
   :math:`[D_x(q D_x u)]^n_i` and lacks the physical interpretation of
   net flux into a cell. With a smooth and slowly varying :math:`q(x)` the
   differences between the two discretizations are not substantial.
   However, when :math:`q` exhibits (potentially large) jumps,
   :math:`[D_x(q D_x u)]^n_i` with harmonic averaging of :math:`q` yields
   a better solution than arithmetic averaging or
   :ref:`(125) <Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:chainrule_scheme>`.
   In the literature, the discretization :math:`[D_x(q D_x u)]^n_i` totally
   dominant and very few mention the possibility of
   :ref:`(125) <Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:chainrule_scheme>`.




.. Needs some better explanation here - maybe the exact solution of a

.. poisson type problem (piecewise linear solution) failes if we use

.. the chain rule? Wesserling has an example, but it is tedious to

.. work out.

.. _wave:pde2:var:c:means:

Computing the coefficient between mesh points
---------------------------------------------

If :math:`q` is a known function of :math:`x`, we can easily evaluate
:math:`q_{i+\half}` simply as :math:`q(x_{i+\half})` with
:math:`x_{i+\half} = x_i + \half\Delta x`.
However, in many cases :math:`c`, and hence :math:`q`,
is only known as a discrete function, often at the mesh points :math:`x_i`.
Evaluating :math:`q` between two mesh points :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_{i+1}` can then
be done by averaging in three ways:

.. index:: geometric mean

.. index:: arithmetic mean

.. index:: harmonic average

.. index::
   single: averaging; geometric

.. index::
   single: averaging; arithmetic

.. index::
   single: averaging; harmonic

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:mean:arithmetic:

.. math::

    \tag{126}
    q_{i+\half} \approx
        \half\left( q_{i} + q_{i+1}\right) =
        [\overline{q}^{x}]_i
        \quad \hbox{(arithmetic mean)}
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:mean:harmonic:

.. math::

    \tag{127}
    q_{i+\half} \approx
        2\left( \frac{1}{q_{i}} + \frac{1}{q_{i+1}}\right)^{-1}
        \quad \hbox{(harmonic mean)}
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:mean:geometric:

.. math::

    \tag{128}
    q_{i+\half} \approx
        \left(q_{i}q_{i+1}\right)^{1/2}
        \quad \hbox{(geometric mean)}
        
        

The arithmetic mean in :ref:`(126) <Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:mean:arithmetic>` is by
far the most commonly used averaging technique and is well suited
for smooth :math:`q(x)` functions.
The harmonic mean is often preferred when :math:`q(x)` exhibits large
jumps (which is typical for geological media).
The geometric mean is less used, but popular in
discretizations to linearize quadratic
nonlinearities (see the section :ref:`vib:ode2:fdm:fquad` for an example).

With the operator notation from :ref:`(126) <Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:mean:arithmetic>`
we can specify the discretization of the complete variable-coefficient
wave equation in a compact way:

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:op:

.. math::

    \tag{129}
    \lbrack D_tD_t u = D_x\overline{q}^{x}D_x u + f\rbrack^{n}_i
        \tp
        
        

From this notation we immediately see what kind of differences that
each term is approximated with. The notation :math:`\overline{q}^{x}`
also specifies that the variable coefficient is approximated by
an arithmetic mean, the definition being
:math:`[\overline{q}^{x}]_{i+\half}=(q_i+q_{i+1})/2`.
With the notation :math:`[D_xq D_x u]^n_i`,
we specify that :math:`q` is evaluated directly, as a function,
between the mesh points:
:math:`q(x_{i-\half})` and :math:`q(x_{i+\half})`.

Before any implementation, it remains to solve
:ref:`(129) <Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:op>` with respect to :math:`u_i^{n+1}`:

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1}_i = - u_i^{n-1}  + 2u_i^n + \nonumber
        

.. math::
          
        \quad \left(\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x}\right)^2 \left(
        \half(q_{i} + q_{i+1})(u_{i+1}^n - u_{i}^n) -
        \half(q_{i} + q_{i-1})(u_{i}^n - u_{i-1}^n)\right)
        + \nonumber
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl:

.. math::

    \tag{130}
    \quad \Delta t^2 f^n_i
        \tp
        
        

.. _wave:pde2:var:c:stability:

How a variable coefficient affects the stability
------------------------------------------------

The stability criterion derived in the section :ref:`wave:pde1:stability`
reads :math:`\Delta t\leq \Delta x/c`. If :math:`c=c(x)`, the criterion will depend
on the spatial location. We must therefore choose a :math:`\Delta t` that
is small enough such that no mesh cell has :math:`\Delta x/c(x) >\Delta t`.
That is, we must use the largest :math:`c` value in the criterion:

.. _Eq:_auto42:

.. math::

    \tag{131}
    \Delta t \leq \beta \frac{\Delta x}{\max_{x\in [0,L]}c(x)}
        \tp
        
        

The parameter :math:`\beta` is included as a safety factor: in some problems with a
significantly varying :math:`c` it turns out that one must choose :math:`\beta <1` to
have stable solutions (:math:`\beta =0.9` may act as an all-round value).

A different strategy to handle the stability criterion with variable
wave velocity is to use a spatially varying :math:`\Delta t`. While the idea
is mathematically attractive at first sight, the implementation quickly
becomes very complicated, so we stick to using a constant :math:`\Delta t`
and a worst case value of :math:`c(x)` (with a safety factor :math:`\beta`).

.. _wave:pde2:var:c:Neumann:

Neumann condition and a variable coefficient
--------------------------------------------

Consider a Neumann condition :math:`\partial u/\partial x=0` at :math:`x=L=N_x\Delta x`,
discretized as

.. math::
         [D_{2x} u]^n_i =
        \frac{u_{i+1}^{n} - u_{i-1}^n}{2\Delta x} = 0\quad u_{i+1}^n = u_{i-1}^n,
        

for :math:`i=N_x`. Using the scheme :ref:`(130) <Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl>`
at the end point :math:`i=N_x` with :math:`u_{i+1}^n=u_{i-1}^n` results in

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1}_i = - u_i^{n-1}  + 2u_i^n + \nonumber
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl:Neumann0:

.. math::

    \tag{132}
    \quad \left(\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x}\right)^2 \left(
        q_{i+\half}(u_{i-1}^n - u_{i}^n) -
        q_{i-\half}(u_{i}^n - u_{i-1}^n)\right)
        + \Delta t^2 f^n_i
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto43:

.. math::

    \tag{133}
    = - u_i^{n-1}  + 2u_i^n + \left(\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x}\right)^2
        (q_{i+\half} + q_{i-\half})(u_{i-1}^n - u_{i}^n) +
        \Delta t^2 f^n_i
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl:Neumann:

.. math::

    \tag{134}
    \approx - u_i^{n-1}  + 2u_i^n + \left(\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x}\right)^2
        2q_{i}(u_{i-1}^n - u_{i}^n) + \Delta t^2 f^n_i
        \tp
        
        

Here we used the approximation

.. math::
        
        q_{i+\half} + q_{i-\half} =
        q_i + \left(\frac{dq}{dx}\right)_i \Delta x
        + \left(\frac{d^2q}{dx^2}\right)_i \Delta x^2 + \cdots
        +\nonumber
        

.. math::
          
        \quad q_i - \left(\frac{dq}{dx}\right)_i \Delta x
        + \left(\frac{d^2q}{dx^2}\right)_i \Delta x^2 + \cdots\nonumber
        

.. math::
          
        = 2q_i + 2\left(\frac{d^2q}{dx^2}\right)_i \Delta x^2 + {\cal O}(\Delta x^4)
        \nonumber
        

.. _Eq:_auto44:

.. math::

    \tag{135}
    \approx 2q_i
        \tp
        
        

An alternative derivation may apply the arithmetic mean of :math:`q` in
:ref:`(132) <Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl:Neumann0>`, leading to the term

.. math::
         (q_i + \half(q_{i+1}+q_{i-1}))(u_{i-1}^n-u_i^n)\tp

Since :math:`\half(q_{i+1}+q_{i-1}) = q_i + {\cal O}(\Delta x^2)`,
we can approximate with :math:`2q_i(u_{i-1}^n-u_i^n)` for :math:`i=N_x` and
get the same term as we did above.

A common technique when implementing :math:`\partial u/\partial x=0`
boundary conditions, is to assume :math:`dq/dx=0` as well. This implies
:math:`q_{i+1}=q_{i-1}` and :math:`q_{i+1/2}=q_{i-1/2}` for :math:`i=N_x`.
The implications for the scheme are

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1}_i = - u_i^{n-1}  + 2u_i^n + \nonumber
        

.. math::
          
        \quad \left(\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x}\right)^2 \left(
        q_{i+\half}(u_{i-1}^n - u_{i}^n) -
        q_{i-\half}(u_{i}^n - u_{i-1}^n)\right)

        \tp
        
        

.. _wave:pde2:var:c:impl:

Implementation of variable coefficients
---------------------------------------

The implementation of the scheme with a variable wave velocity :math:`q(x)=c^2(x)`
may assume that :math:`q` is available as an array ``q[i]`` at
the spatial mesh points. The following loop is a straightforward
implementation of the scheme :ref:`(130) <Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl>`:

.. code-block:: python

        for i in range(1, Nx):
            u[i] = - u_2[i] + 2*u_1[i] + \ 
                   C2*(0.5*(q[i] + q[i+1])*(u_1[i+1] - u_1[i])  - \ 
                       0.5*(q[i] + q[i-1])*(u_1[i] - u_1[i-1])) + \ 
                   dt2*f(x[i], t[n])

The coefficient ``C2`` is now defined as ``(dt/dx)**2``, i.e., *not* as the
squared Courant number, since the wave velocity is variable and appears
inside the parenthesis.

With Neumann conditions :math:`u_x=0` at the
boundary, we need to combine this scheme with the discrete
version of the boundary condition, as shown in the section :ref:`wave:pde2:var:c:Neumann`.
Nevertheless, it would be convenient to reuse the formula for the
interior points and just modify the indices ``ip1=i+1`` and ``im1=i-1``
as we did in the section :ref:`wave:pde2:Neumann:impl`. Assuming
:math:`dq/dx=0` at the boundaries, we can implement the scheme at
the boundary with the following code.

.. code-block:: python

        i = 0
        ip1 = i+1
        im1 = ip1
        u[i] = - u_2[i] + 2*u_1[i] + \ 
               C2*(0.5*(q[i] + q[ip1])*(u_1[ip1] - u_1[i])  - \ 
                   0.5*(q[i] + q[im1])*(u_1[i] - u_1[im1])) + \ 
               dt2*f(x[i], t[n])

With ghost cells we can just reuse the formula for the interior
points also at the boundary, provided that the ghost values of both
:math:`u` and :math:`q` are correctly updated to ensure :math:`u_x=0` and :math:`q_x=0`.

A vectorized version of the scheme with a variable coefficient
at internal mesh points becomes

.. code-block:: python

        u[1:-1] = - u_2[1:-1] + 2*u_1[1:-1] + \ 
                  C2*(0.5*(q[1:-1] + q[2:])*(u_1[2:] - u_1[1:-1]) -
                      0.5*(q[1:-1] + q[:-2])*(u_1[1:-1] - u_1[:-2])) + \ 
                  dt2*f(x[1:-1], t[n])

A more general PDE model with variable coefficients
---------------------------------------------------

Sometimes a wave PDE has a variable coefficient in front of
the time-derivative term:

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:pde2:

.. math::

    \tag{138}
    \varrho(x)\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} =
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( q(x)
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right) + f(x,t)
        
        \tp
        

One example appears when modeling elastic waves in a rod
with varying density, cf. |nbsp| (:ref:`wave:app:string`) with :math:`\varrho (x)`.

A natural scheme for :ref:`(138) <Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:pde2>` is

    [\varrho D_tD_t u = D_x\overline{q}^xD_x u + f]^n_i
        \tp
        
        

We realize that the :math:`\varrho` coefficient poses no particular
difficulty, since :math:`\varrho` enters the formula just a simple factor
in front of a derivative. There is hence no need for any averaging
of :math:`\varrho`. Often, :math:`\varrho` will be moved to the right-hand side,
also without any difficulty:

Generalization: damping
-----------------------

Waves die out by two mechanisms. In 2D and 3D the energy of the wave
spreads out in space, and energy conservation then requires
the amplitude to decrease. This effect is not present in 1D.
Damping is another cause of amplitude reduction. For example,
the vibrations of a string die out because of damping due to
air resistance and non-elastic effects in the string.

The simplest way of including damping is to add a first-order derivative
to the equation (in the same way as friction forces enter a vibrating
mechanical system):

.. _Eq:wave:pde3:

.. math::

    \tag{141}
    \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} + b\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =
        c^2\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
         + f(x,t),
        
        

where :math:`b \geq 0` is a prescribed damping coefficient.

A typical discretization of :ref:`(141) <Eq:wave:pde3>` in terms of centered
differences reads

.. _Eq:wave:pde3:fd:

.. math::

    \tag{142}
    [D_tD_t u + bD_{2t}u = c^2D_xD_x u + f]^n_i
        \tp
        
        

Writing out the equation and solving for the unknown :math:`u^{n+1}_i`
gives the scheme

.. _Eq:wave:pde3:fd2:

.. math::

    \tag{143}
    u^{n+1}_i = (1 + {\half}b\Delta t)^{-1}(({\half}b\Delta t -1)
        u^{n-1}_i + 2u^n_i + C^2
        \left(u^{n}_{i+1}-2u^{n}_{i} + u^{n}_{i-1}\right) + \Delta t^2 f^n_i),
        
        

for :math:`i\in\seti{\Ix}` and :math:`n\geq 1`.
New equations must be derived for :math:`u^1_i`, and for boundary points in case
of Neumann conditions.

The damping is very small in many wave phenomena and thus only evident
for very long time simulations. This makes the standard wave equation
without damping relevant for a lot of applications.

Building a general 1D wave equation solver
==========================================

The program `wave1D_dn_vc.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave1D/wave1D_dn_vc.py>`__
is a fairly general code for 1D wave propagation problems that
targets the following initial-boundary value problem

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:software:ueq:

.. math::

    \tag{144}
    u_{tt} = (c^2(x)u_x)_x + f(x,t),\quad x\in (0,L),\ t\in (0,T]
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto48:

.. math::

    \tag{145}
    u(x,0) = I(x),\quad x\in [0,L]
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto49:

.. math::

    \tag{146}
    u_t(x,0) = V(t),\quad x\in [0,L]
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto50:

.. math::

    \tag{147}
    u(0,t) = U_0(t)\hbox{ or } u_x(0,t)=0,\quad t\in (0,T]
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:software:bcL:

.. math::

    \tag{148}
    u(L,t) = U_L(t)\hbox{ or } u_x(L,t)=0,\quad t\in (0,T]
        
        

The only new feature here is the time-dependent Dirichlet conditions.
These are trivial to implement:

.. code-block:: python

        i = Ix[0]  # x=0
        u[i] = U_0(t[n+1])
        
        i = Ix[-1] # x=L
        u[i] = U_L(t[n+1])

The ``solver`` function is a natural extension of the simplest
``solver`` function in the initial ``wave1D_u0.py`` program,
extended with Neumann boundary conditions (:math:`u_x=0`),
a the time-varying Dirichlet conditions, as well as
a variable wave velocity. The different code segments needed
to make these extensions have been shown and commented upon in the
preceding text. We refer to the ``solver`` function in the
``wave1D_dn_vc.py`` file for all the details.

The vectorization is only applied inside the time loop, not for the
initial condition or the first time steps, since this initial work
is negligible for long time simulations in 1D problems.

The following sections explain various more advanced programming
techniques applied in the general 1D wave equation solver.

User action function as a class
-------------------------------

A useful feature in the ``wave1D_dn_vc.py`` program is the specification of
the ``user_action`` function as a class. This part of the program may
need some motivation and explanation. Although the ``plot_u_st``
function (and the ``PlotMatplotlib`` class)
in the ``wave1D_u0.viz`` function
remembers the local variables in the ``viz`` function, it is a
cleaner solution to store the needed variables together with
the function, which is exactly what a class offers.

The code
~~~~~~~~

A class for flexible plotting, cleaning up files, making movie
files, like the function ``wave1D_u0.viz`` did, can be coded as follows:

        class PlotAndStoreSolution:
            """

Dissection
~~~~~~~~~~

Understanding this class requires quite some familiarity with Python
in general and class programming in particular.
The class supports plotting with Matplotlib (``backend=None``) or
SciTools (``backend=matplotlib`` or ``backend=gnuplot``) for maximum
flexibility.

.. Since all the plot frames are to be collected in a separate subdirectory,

.. we demand a (logical) "casename" from the user that is used as

.. subdirectory name in the ``make_movie_file`` method. The statements

.. in this method perform actions normally done in the operating

.. system, but the Python interface via ``shutil.rmtree``, ``os.mkdir``,

.. ``os.chdir``, etc., works on all platforms where Python works.

The constructor shows how we can flexibly import the plotting engine
as (typically) ``scitools.easyviz.gnuplot_`` or
``scitools.easyviz.matplotlib_`` (note the trailing underscore - it is required).
With the ``screen_movie`` parameter
we can suppress displaying each movie frame on the screen.
Alternatively, for slow movies associated with
fine meshes, one can set
``skip_frame=10``, causing every 10 frames to be shown.

The ``__call__`` method makes ``PlotAndStoreSolution`` instances behave like
functions, so we can just pass an instance, say ``p``, as the
``user_action`` argument in the ``solver`` function, and any call to
``user_action`` will be a call to ``p.__call__``. The ``__call__``
method plots the solution on the screen,
saves the plot to file, and stores the solution in a file for
later retrieval.

More details on storing the solution in files appear in
the section :ref:`softeng2:wave1D:filestorage:hashlib`.

Pulse propagation in two media
------------------------------

The function ``pulse`` in ``wave1D_dn_vc.py`` demonstrates wave motion in
heterogeneous media where :math:`c` varies. One can specify an interval
where the wave velocity is decreased by a factor ``slowness_factor``
(or increased by making this factor less than one).
Figure :ref:`wave:pde1:fig:pulse1:two:media` shows a typical simulation
scenario.

Four types of initial conditions are available:

1. a rectangular pulse (``plug``),

2. a Gaussian function (``gaussian``),

3. a "cosine hat" consisting of one period of the cosine function
   (``cosinehat``),

4. half a period of a "cosine hat" (``half-cosinehat``)

These peak-shaped initial
conditions can be placed in the middle (``loc='center'``) or at
the left end (``loc='left'``) of the domain.
With the pulse in the middle, it splits in two parts, each with half the
initial amplitude, traveling in opposite directions. With the pulse
at the left end, centered at :math:`x=0`, and using the
symmetry condition :math:`\partial u/\partial x=0`, only a right-going pulse
is generated. There is also a left-going pulse, but it travels from :math:`x=0`
in negative :math:`x` direction and is not visible in the domain :math:`[0,L]`.

The ``pulse``
function is a flexible tool for playing around with various wave
shapes and location of a medium with a different wave velocity.

The code is shown to demonstrate how easy it is to reach this
flexibility with the building blocks we have already developed:

.. code-block:: python

        def pulse(C=1,            # aximum Courant number

            medium. The loc parameter can be 'center' or 'left',

The ``PlotMediumAndSolution`` class used here is a subclass of
``PlotAndStoreSolution`` where the medium with reduced :math:`c` value,
as specified by the ``medium`` interval,
is visualized in the plots.


.. admonition:: Comment on the choices of discretization parameters

   The argument :math:`N_x` in the ``pulse`` function does not correspond to
   the actual spatial resolution of :math:`C<1`, since the ``solver``
   function takes a fixed :math:`\Delta t` and :math:`C`, and adjusts :math:`\Delta x`
   accordingly. As seen in the ``pulse`` function,
   the specified :math:`\Delta t` is chosen according to the
   limit :math:`C=1`, so if :math:`C<1`, :math:`\Delta t` remains the same, but the
   ``solver`` function operates with a larger :math:`\Delta x` and smaller
   :math:`N_x` than was specified in the call to ``pulse``. The practical reason
   is that we always want to keep :math:`\Delta t` fixed such that
   plot frames and movies are synchronized in time regardless of the
   value of :math:`C` (i.e., :math:`\Delta x` is varies when the
   Courant number varies).




The reader is encouraged to play around with the ``pulse`` function:

.. code-block:: ipy

        >>> import wave1D_dn_vc as w
        >>> w.pulse(loc='left', pulse_tp='cosinehat', Nx=50, every_frame=10)

To easily kill the graphics by Ctrl-C and restart a new simulation it might be
easier to run the above two statements from the command line
with

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> python -c 'import wave1D_dn_vc as w; w.pulse(...)'

Exercise 23: Find the analytical solution to a damped wave equation
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider the wave equation with damping :ref:`(141) <Eq:wave:pde3>`.
The goal is to find an exact solution to a wave problem with damping.
A starting point is the standing wave solution from
:ref:`wave:exer:standingwave`. It becomes necessary to
include a damping term :math:`e^{-ct}` and also have both a sine and cosine
component in time:

.. math::

Problem 24: Explore symmetry boundary conditions

Consider the simple "plug" wave where :math:`\Omega = [-L,L]` and

        1, & x\in [-\delta, \delta],\\

:math:`u_t(x,0)=0` and there is no source term :math:`f`.
The boundary conditions can be set to :math:`u=0`.
The solution to this problem is symmetric around :math:`x=0`.

Problem 28: Implement open boundary conditions
----------------------------------------------

.. index:: radiation condition

.. index:: open boundary condition

.. index::
   single: boundary condition; open (radiation)

To enable a wave to leave the computational domain and travel
undisturbed through
the boundary :math:`x=L`, one can in a one-dimensional problem impose the
following condition, called a *radiation condition* or
*open boundary condition*:

.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq:

.. math::

    \tag{149}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + c\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0\tp
        
        

The parameter :math:`c` is the wave velocity.

Show that :ref:`(149) <Eq:wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq>` accepts
a solution :math:`u = g_R(x-ct)` (right-going wave),
but not :math:`u = g_L(x+ct)` (left-going wave). This means
that :ref:`(149) <Eq:wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq>` will allow any
right-going wave :math:`g_R(x-ct)` to pass through the boundary undisturbed.

A corresponding open boundary condition for a left-going wave
through :math:`x=0` is

.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eqL:

.. math::

    \tag{150}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - c\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0\tp
        
        

**a)**
A natural idea for discretizing
the condition :ref:`(149) <Eq:wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq>`
at the spatial end point :math:`i=N_x` is to apply
centered differences in time and space:

.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq:op:

.. math::

    \tag{151}
    [D_{2t}u + cD_{2x}u =0]^n_{i},\quad i=N_x\tp
        
        

Eliminate the fictitious value :math:`u_{N_x+1}^n` by using
the discrete equation at the same point.

The equation for the first step, :math:`u_i^1`, is in principle also affected,
but we can then use the condition :math:`u_{N_x}=0` since the wave
has not yet reached the right boundary.

**b)**
A much more convenient implementation of the open boundary condition
at :math:`x=L` can be based on an explicit discretization

.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq:op:1storder:

.. math::

    \tag{152}
    [D^+_tu + cD_x^- u = 0]_i^n,\quad i=N_x\tp
        
        

From this equation, one can solve for :math:`u^{n+1}_{N_x}` and apply the
formula as a Dirichlet condition at the boundary point.
However, the finite difference approximations involved are of
first order.

Implement this scheme for a wave equation
:math:`u_{tt}=c^2u_{xx}` in a domain :math:`[0,L]`,
where you have :math:`u_x=0` at :math:`x=0`, the condition :ref:`(149) <Eq:wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq>`
at :math:`x=L`, and an initial disturbance in the middle
of the domain, e.g., a plug profile like

.. math::
         u(x,0) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll} 1,& L/2-\ell \leq x \leq  L/2+\ell,\\ 
        0,\hbox{otherwise}\end{array}\right.
        

Observe that the initial wave is split in two, the left-going wave
is reflected at :math:`x=0`, and both waves travel out of :math:`x=L`,
leaving the solution as :math:`u=0` in :math:`[0,L]`. Use a unit Courant number
such that the numerical solution is exact.
Make a movie to illustrate what happens.

Because this simplified
implementation of the open boundary condition works, there is no
need to pursue the more complicated discretization in a).

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
Modify the solver function in
`wave1D_dn.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave1D/wave1D_dn.py>`__.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

**c)**
Add the possibility to have either :math:`u_x=0` or an open boundary
condition at the left boundary. The latter condition is discretized
as

.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq:op:1storder2:

.. math::

    \tag{153}
    [D^+_tu - cD_x^+ u = 0]_i^n,\quad i=0,
        
        

leading to an explicit update of the boundary value :math:`u^{n+1}_0`.

The implementation can be tested with a Gaussian function as initial condition:

.. math::
         g(x;m,s) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}s}e^{-\frac{(x-m)^2}{2s^2}}\tp

Run two tests:

1. Disturbance in the middle of the domain, :math:`I(x)=g(x;L/2,s)`, and
   open boundary condition at the left end.

2. Disturbance at the left end, :math:`I(x)=g(x;0,s)`, and :math:`u_x=0`
   as symmetry boundary condition at this end.

Make nose tests for both cases, testing that the solution is zero
after the waves have left the domain.

**d)**
In 2D and 3D it is difficult to compute the correct wave velocity
normal to the boundary, which is needed in generalizations of
the open boundary conditions in higher dimensions. Test the effect
of having a slightly wrong wave velocity in
:ref:`(152) <Eq:wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq:op:1storder>`.
Make a movies to illustrate what happens.

.. Closing remarks for this Problem

Remarks          (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The condition :ref:`(149) <Eq:wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq>`
works perfectly in 1D when :math:`c` is known. In 2D and 3D, however, the
condition reads :math:`u_t + c_x u_x + c_y u_y=0`, where :math:`c_x` and
:math:`c_y` are the wave speeds in the :math:`x` and :math:`y` directions. Estimating
these components (i.e., the direction of the wave) is often
challenging. Other methods are normally used in 2D and 3D to
let waves move out of a computational domain.

Exercise 29: Implement periodic boundary conditions
---------------------------------------------------

.. index:: periodic boundary conditions

.. index::
   single: boundary conditions; periodic

It is frequently of interest to follow wave motion over large
distances and long times. A straightforward approach is to
work with a very large domain, but might lead to a lot of
computations in areas of the domain where the waves cannot
be noticed. A more efficient approach is to let a right-going
wave out of the domain and at the same time let it enter
the domain on the left. This is called a *periodic boundary
condition*.

The boundary condition at the right end :math:`x=L` is an open boundary
condition (see :ref:`wave:app:exer:radiationBC`) to let a
right-going wave out of the domain.  At the left end, :math:`x=0`, we apply,
in the beginning of the simulation, either a symmetry boundary
condition (see :ref:`wave:exer:symmetry:bc`) :math:`u_x=0`, or an
open boundary condition.

This initial wave will split in two and either reflected or
transported out of the domain at :math:`x=0`. The purpose of the exercise is
to follow the right-going wave. We can do that with a *periodic
boundary condition*.  This means that when the right-going wave hits
the boundary :math:`x=L`, the open boundary condition lets the wave out of
the domain, but at the same time we use a boundary condition on the
left end :math:`x=0` that feeds the outgoing wave into the domain
again. This periodic condition is simply :math:`u(0)=u(L)`. The switch from
:math:`u_x=0` or an open boundary condition at the left end to a periodic
condition can happen when :math:`u(L,t)>\epsilon`, where :math:`\epsilon =10^{-4}`
might be an appropriate value for determining when the right-going
wave hits the boundary :math:`x=L`.

The open boundary conditions can conveniently be discretized as
explained in :ref:`wave:app:exer:radiationBC`.  Implement the
described type of boundary conditions and test them on two different
initial shapes: a plug :math:`u(x,0)=1` for :math:`x\leq 0.1`, :math:`u(x,0)=0` for
:math:`x>0.1`, and a Gaussian function in the middle of the domain:
:math:`u(x,0)=\exp{(-\frac{1}{2}(x-0.5)^2/0.05)}`. The domain is the unit
interval :math:`[0,1]`. Run these two shapes for Courant numbers 1 and
0.5. Assume constant wave velocity.  Make movies of the four cases.
Reason why the solutions are correct.

Exercise 30: Compare discretizations of a Neumann condition
-----------------------------------------------------------

We have a 1D wave equation with variable wave velocity:
:math:`u_{tt}=(qu_x)_x`.
A Neumann condition :math:`u_x` at :math:`x=0, L` can be
discretized as shown in :ref:`(134) <Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl:Neumann>`
and :ref:`(137) <Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl:Neumann2>`.

The aim of this exercise is to examine the rate of the numerical
error when using different ways of discretizing the Neumann condition.

**a)**
As a test problem, :math:`q=1+(x-L/2)^4` can be used, with :math:`f(x,t)`
adapted such that the solution has a simple form, say
:math:`u(x,t)=\cos (\pi x/L)\cos (\omega t)` for, e.g., :math:`\omega = 1`.
Perform numerical experiments and find the convergence rate of the
error using the approximation
:ref:`(134) <Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl:Neumann>`.

**b)**
Switch to :math:`q(x)=1+\cos(\pi x/L)`, which is symmetric at :math:`x=0,L`,
and check the convergence rate
of the scheme
:ref:`(137) <Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl:Neumann2>`. Now,
:math:`q_{i-1/2}` is a 2nd-order approximation to :math:`q_i`,
:math:`q_{i-1/2}=q_i + 0.25q_i''\Delta x^2 + \cdots`, because :math:`q_i'=0`
for :math:`i=N_x` (a similar argument can be applied to the case :math:`i=0`).

**c)**
A third discretization can be based on a simple and convenient,
but less accurate, one-sided difference:
:math:`u_{i}-u_{i-1}=0` at :math:`i=N_x` and :math:`u_{i+1}-u_i=0` at :math:`i=0`.
Derive the resulting scheme in detail and implement it.
Run experiments with :math:`q` from a) or b) to establish the rate of convergence
of the scheme.

**d)**
A fourth technique is to view the scheme as

.. math::
         [D_tD_tu]^n_i = \frac{1}{\Delta x}\left(
        [qD_xu]_{i+\half}^n - [qD_xu]_{i-\half}^n\right)
        + [f]_i^n,

and place the boundary at :math:`x_{i+\half}`, :math:`i=N_x`, instead of
exactly at the physical boundary. With this idea of approximating (moving) the
boundary,
we can just set :math:`[qD_xu]_{i+\half}^n=0`.
Derive the complete scheme
using this technique. The implementation of the boundary condition at
:math:`L-\Delta x/2` is :math:`\Oof{\Delta x^2}` accurate, but the interesting question
is what impact the movement of the boundary has on the convergence
rate. Compute the errors as usual over the entire mesh and use :math:`q` from
a) or b).

Exercise 31: Verification by a cubic polynomial in space
--------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this exercise is to verify the implementation of the
``solver`` function in the program `wave1D_n0.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave1D/wave1D_n0.py>`__ by using an exact numerical solution
for the wave equation :math:`u_{tt}=c^2u_{xx} + f` with Neumann boundary
conditions :math:`u_x(0,t)=u_x(L,t)=0`.

A similar verification is used in the file `wave1D_u0.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave1D/wave1D_u0.py>`__, which solves the same PDE, but with
Dirichlet boundary conditions :math:`u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0`.  The idea of the
verification test in function ``test_quadratic`` in ``wave1D_u0.py`` is to
produce a solution that is a lower-order polynomial such that both the
PDE problem, the boundary conditions, and all the discrete equations
are exactly fulfilled. Then the ``solver`` function should reproduce
this exact solution to machine precision.  More precisely, we seek
:math:`u=X(x)T(t)`, with :math:`T(t)` as a linear function and :math:`X(x)` as a
parabola that fulfills the boundary conditions.  Inserting this :math:`u` in
the PDE determines :math:`f`.  It turns out that :math:`u` also fulfills the
discrete equations, because the truncation error of the discretized
PDE has derivatives in :math:`x` and :math:`t` of order four and higher. These
derivatives all vanish for a quadratic :math:`X(x)` and linear :math:`T(t)`.

It would be attractive to use a similar approach in the case of
Neumann conditions. We set :math:`u=X(x)T(t)` and seek lower-order
polynomials :math:`X` and :math:`T`.
To force :math:`u_x` to vanish at the boundary, we let :math:`X_x` be
a parabola. Then :math:`X` is a cubic polynomial. The fourth-order
derivative of a cubic polynomial vanishes, so :math:`u=X(x)T(t)`
will fulfill the discretized PDE also in this case, if :math:`f`
is adjusted such that :math:`u` fulfills the PDE.

However, the discrete boundary condition is not exactly fulfilled
by this choice of :math:`u`. The reason is that

.. _Eq:wave:fd2:exer:verify:cubic:D2x:

.. math::

    \tag{154}
    [D_{2x}u]^n_i = u_{x}(x_i,t_n) + \frac{1}{6}u_{xxx}(x_i,t_n)\Delta x^2
        + \Oof{\Delta x^4}\tp
        
        

At the boundary two boundary points, :math:`X_x(x)=0` such that :math:`u_x=0`.
However, :math:`u_{xxx}` is a constant and not zero
when :math:`X(x)` is a cubic polynomial.
Therefore, our :math:`u=X(x)T(t)` fulfills

.. math::
         [D_{2x}u]^n_i = \frac{1}{6}u_{xxx}(x_i,t_n)\Delta x^2,
        

and not

.. math::
         [D_{2x}u]^n_i =0, \quad i=0,N_x,

as it should. (Note that all the higher-order terms :math:`\Oof{\Delta x^4}`
also have higher-order derivatives that vanish for a cubic polynomial.)
So to summarize, the fundamental problem is that :math:`u` as a product of
a cubic polynomial and a linear or quadratic polynomial in time
is not an exact solution of the discrete boundary conditions.

To make progress,
we assume that :math:`u=X(x)T(t)`, where :math:`T` for simplicity is taken as a
prescribed linear function :math:`1+\frac{1}{2}t`, and :math:`X(x)` is taken
as an *unknown* cubic polynomial :math:`\sum_{j=0}^3 a_jx^j`.
There are two different ways of determining the coefficients
:math:`a_0,\ldots,a_3` such that both the discretized PDE and the
discretized boundary conditions are fulfilled, under the
constraint that we can specify a function :math:`f(x,t)` for the PDE to feed
to the ``solver`` function in ``wave1D_n0.py``. Both approaches
are explained in the subexercises.

.. {wave:fd2:exer:verify:cubic:D2x}

**a)**
One can insert :math:`u` in the discretized PDE and find the corresponding :math:`f`.
Then one can insert :math:`u` in the discretized boundary conditions.
This yields two equations for the four coefficients :math:`a_0,\ldots,a_3`.
To find the coefficients, one can set :math:`a_0=0` and :math:`a_1=1` for
simplicity and then determine :math:`a_2` and :math:`a_3`. This approach will make
:math:`a_2` and :math:`a_3` depend on :math:`\Delta x` and :math:`f` will depend on both
:math:`\Delta x` and :math:`\Delta t`.

Use ``sympy`` to perform analytical computations.
A starting point is to define :math:`u` as follows:

.. code-block:: python

        def test_cubic1():
            import sympy as sm
            x, t, c, L, dx, dt = sm.symbols('x t c L dx dt')
            i, n = sm.symbols('i n', integer=True)
        
            # Assume discrete solution is a polynomial of degree 3 in x
            T = lambda t: 1 + sm.Rational(1,2)*t  # Temporal term
            a = sm.symbols('a_0 a_1 a_2 a_3')
            X = lambda x: sum(a[q]*x**q for q in range(4))  # Spatial term
            u = lambda x, t: X(x)*T(t)

The symbolic expression for :math:`u` is reached by calling ``u(x,t)``
with ``x`` and ``t`` as ``sympy`` symbols.

Define ``DxDx(u, i, n)``, ``DtDt(u, i, n)``, and ``D2x(u, i, n)``
as Python functions for returning the difference
approximations :math:`[D_xD_x u]^n_i`, :math:`[D_tD_t u]^n_i`, and
:math:`[D_{2x}u]^n_i`. The next step is to set up the residuals
for the equations :math:`[D_{2x}u]^n_0=0` and :math:`[D_{2x}u]^n_{N_x}=0`,
where :math:`N_x=L/\Delta x`. Call the residuals ``R_0`` and ``R_L``.
Substitute :math:`a_0` and :math:`a_1` by 0 and 1, respectively, in
``R_0``, ``R_L``, and ``a``:

.. code-block:: python

        R_0 = R_0.subs(a[0], 0).subs(a[1], 1)
        R_L = R_L.subs(a[0], 0).subs(a[1], 1)
        a = list(a)  # enable in-place assignment
        a[0:2] = 0, 1

Determining :math:`a_2` and :math:`a_3` from the discretized boundary conditions
is then about solving two equations with respect to :math:`a_2` and :math:`a_3`,
i.e., ``a[2:]``:

.. code-block:: python

        s = sm.solve([R_0, R_L], a[2:])
        # s is dictionary with the unknowns a[2] and a[3] as keys
        a[2:] = s[a[2]], s[a[3]]

Now, ``a`` contains computed values and ``u`` will automatically use
these new values since ``X`` accesses ``a``.

Compute the source term :math:`f` from the discretized PDE:
:math:`f^n_i = [D_tD_t u - c^2D_xD_x u]^n_i`. Turn :math:`u`, the time
derivative :math:`u_t` (needed for the initial condition :math:`V(x)`),
and :math:`f` into Python functions. Set numerical values for
:math:`L`, :math:`N_x`, :math:`C`, and :math:`c`. Prescribe the time interval as
:math:`\Delta t = CL/(N_xc)`, which imply :math:`\Delta x = c\Delta t/C = L/N_x`.
Define new functions ``I(x)``, ``V(x)``, and ``f(x,t)`` as wrappers of the ones
made above, where fixed values of :math:`L`, :math:`c`, :math:`\Delta x`, and :math:`\Delta t`
are inserted, such that ``I``, ``V``, and ``f`` can be passed on to the
``solver`` function. Finally, call ``solver`` with a ``user_action``
function that compares the numerical solution to this exact
solution :math:`u` of the discrete PDE problem.

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
To turn a ``sympy`` expression ``e``, depending on a series of
symbols, say ``x``, ``t``, ``dx``, ``dt``, ``L``, and ``c``, into plain
Python function ``e_exact(x,t,L,dx,dt,c)``, one can write

.. code-block:: python

        e_exact = sm.lambdify([x,t,L,dx,dt,c], e, 'numpy')

The ``'numpy'`` argument is a good habit as the ``e_exact`` function
will then work with array arguments if it contains mathematical
functions (but here we only do plain arithmetics, which automatically
work with arrays).

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

**b)**
An alternative way of determining :math:`a_0,\ldots,a_3` is to reason as
follows. We first construct :math:`X(x)` such that the boundary conditions
are fulfilled: :math:`X=x(L-x)`. However, to compensate for the fact
that this choice of :math:`X` does not fulfill the discrete boundary
condition, we seek :math:`u` such that

.. math::
         u_x = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}x(L-x)T(t) - \frac{1}{6}u_{xxx}\Delta x^2,

since this :math:`u` will fit the discrete boundary condition.
Assuming :math:`u=T(t)\sum_{j=0}^3a_jx^j`, we can use the above equation to
determine the coefficients :math:`a_1,a_2,a_3`. A value, e.g., 1 can be used for
:math:`a_0`. The following ``sumpy`` code computes this :math:`u`:

.. code-block:: python

        def test_cubic2():
            import sympy as sm
            x, t, c, L, dx = sm.symbols('x t c L dx')
            T = lambda t: 1 + sm.Rational(1,2)*t  # Temporal term
            # Set u as a 3rd-degree polynomial in space
            X = lambda x: sum(a[i]*x**i for i in range(4))
            a = sm.symbols('a_0 a_1 a_2 a_3')
            u = lambda x, t: X(x)*T(t)
            # Force discrete boundary condition to be zero by adding
            # a correction term the analytical suggestion x*(L-x)*T
            # u_x = x*(L-x)*T(t) - 1/6*u_xxx*dx**2
            R = sm.diff(u(x,t), x) - (
                x*(L-x) - sm.Rational(1,6)*sm.diff(u(x,t), x, x, x)*dx**2)
            # R is a polynomial: force all coefficients to vanish.
            # Turn R to Poly to extract coefficients:
            R = sm.poly(R, x)
            coeff = R.all_coeffs()
            s = sm.solve(coeff, a[1:])  # a[0] is not present in R
            # s is dictionary with a[i] as keys
            # Fix a[0] as 1
            s[a[0]] = 1
            X = lambda x: sm.simplify(sum(s[a[i]]*x**i for i in range(4)))
            u = lambda x, t: X(x)*T(t)
            print 'u:', u(x,t)

The next step is to find the source term ``f_e`` by inserting ``u_e``
in the PDE. Thereafter, turn ``u``, ``f``, and the time derivative of ``u``
into plain Python functions as in a), and then wrap these functions
in new functions ``I``, ``V``, and ``f``, with the right signature as
required by the ``solver`` function. Set parameters as in a) and
check that the solution is exact to machine precision at each
time level using an appropriate ``user_action`` function.
