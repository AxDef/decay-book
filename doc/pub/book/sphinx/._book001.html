<span id="ch-preface"></span><h1>Preface<a class="headerlink" href="#preface" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>This book teaches the basic components in the scientific
computing pipeline: modeling, differential equations, numerical
algorithms, programming, plotting, and software testing. The pedagogical idea
is to treat these topics in the context of a very simple
mathematical model, the
differential equation for exponential decay, <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}(t)=-au(t)\)</span>,
where <span class="math">\(u\)</span> is unknown and <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is a given parameter. By keeping the
mathematical problem simple, the text can go deep into all details
about how one must combine mathematics and computer science to
create well-tested, reliable, and flexible software for such a
mathematical model.</p>
<p>The writing style is gentle and aims at a broad audience.
Prerequisite knowledge is basic one-dimensional calculus and preferably
some experience with computer programming in Python or MATLAB.
The material was initially written for self study and therefore features
comprehensive and easy-to-understand explanations. For
some readers it may act as an overview and refresher of traditional
mathematical topics and likely a first introduction to many of the
software topics. The text can also be used
as a case-based and mathematically simple introduction to modern
multi-disciplinary problem solving with computers, using the
range of applications in the chapter <a class="reference internal" href="._book007.html#decay-app"><span class="std std-ref">Models</span></a>
as motivation and then treating the details of
the mathematical and computer science subjects from the other
chapters.</p>
<p>The choice of topics in this book is motivated from what is needed in
more advanced courses on finite difference methods for partial
differential equations (PDEs).  It turns out that a range of concepts
and tools needed for PDEs can be introduced and illustrated by very
simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) examples. The goal of the
text is therefore to lay a foundation for understanding numerical
methods for PDEs by first meeting the fundamental ideas in a simpler
ODE setting. Compared to other books, the present one has a much
stronger focus on how to turn mathematics into working code.
It also explains the mathematics and programming in more detail
than what is common in the literature.</p>
<p>There is a more advanced companion book in the works that treat finite
difference methods for PDEs using the same writing style and having
the same focus on turning mathematical algorithms into reliable
software.</p>
<p>Although the main example in the present book is <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=-au\)</span>, we
also address the more general model problem <span class="math">\(u'=-a(t)u + b(t)\)</span>, and
the completely general, nonlinear problem <span class="math">\(u'=f(u,t)\)</span>, both for scalar
and vector <span class="math">\(u(t)\)</span>. The author believes in the principle <em>simplify,
understand, and then generalize</em>. That is why we start out with the
simple model <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=-au\)</span> and try to understand how methods are
constructed, how they work, how they are implemented, and how they may
fail for this problem, before we generalize what we have learned from
<span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=-au\)</span> to more complicated models.</p>
<p>The following list of topics will be elaborated on.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>How to think when constructing finite difference methods, with special focus
on the Forward Euler, Backward Euler, and Crank-Nicolson (midpoint)
schemes.</li>
<li>How to formulate a computational algorithm and translate it into
Python code.</li>
<li>How to make curve plots of the solutions.</li>
<li>How to compute numerical errors.</li>
<li>How to compute convergence rates.</li>
<li>How to test that an implementation is correct (verification) and how
to automate tests through <em>test functions</em> and <em>unit testing</em>.</li>
<li>How to work with Python concepts such as arrays, lists, dictionaries,
lambda functions, and functions in functions (closures).</li>
<li>How to perform array computing and understand the difference from
scalar computing.</li>
<li>How to uncover numerical artifacts in the computed solution.</li>
<li>How to analyze the numerical schemes mathematically to understand
why artifacts may occur.</li>
<li>How to derive mathematical expressions for various measures of
the error in numerical methods, frequently by using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sympy</span></code> software
for symbolic computations.</li>
<li>How to understand concepts such as finite difference operators,
mesh (grid), mesh functions,
stability, truncation error, consistency, and convergence.</li>
<li>How to solve the general nonlinear ODE <span class="math">\(u'=f(u,t)\)</span>,
which is either a scalar ODE or a system of ODEs (i.e., <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(f\)</span>
can either be a function or a vector of functions).</li>
<li>How to access professional packages for solving ODEs.</li>
<li>How the model equation <span class="math">\(u'=-au\)</span> arises in a wide range
of phenomena in physics, biology, chemistry, and finance.</li>
<li>How to structure a code in terms of functions.</li>
<li>How to make reusable modules.</li>
<li>How to read input data flexibly from the command line.</li>
<li>How to create graphical/web user interfaces.</li>
<li>How to use test frameworks for automatic unit testing.</li>
<li>How to refactor code in terms of classes (instead of functions).</li>
<li>How to conduct and automate large-scale numerical experiments.</li>
<li>How to write scientific reports in various formats (LaTeX, HTML).</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="admonition-the-exposition-in-a-nutshell admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">The exposition in a nutshell</p>
<p>Everything we cover is put into a practical, hands-on context. All
mathematics is translated into working computing codes, and all the
mathematical theory of finite difference methods presented here is
motivated from a strong need to understand why we occasionally obtain
strange results from the programs.
Two fundamental questions saturate the text:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>How do we solve a differential equation problem and produce numbers?</li>
<li>How do we know that the numbers are correct?</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="last">Besides answering these two questions, one will learn a
lot about mathematical modeling in general and the interplay between
physics, mathematics, numerical methods, and computer science.</p>
</div>
<p>The book contains a set of exercises in most of the chapters.
The exercises are divided into three categories: <em>exercises</em>
refer to the text (usually variations or extensions of examples
in the text), <em>problems</em> are stand-alone exercises without
references to the text, and <em>projects</em> are larger problems.
Exercises, problems, and projects share the same numbering to
avoid confusion between Exercise 4.3 and Problem 4.3.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgments<a class="headerlink" href="#acknowledgments" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Professor Svein Linge has provided very detailed and constructive feedback
on this text, and all his efforts are highly appreciated. I also want to thank a
number of students who have pointed out weaknesses and
found errors. The proof reading of Yapi Donatien Achou is much appreciated.
Many thanks also to Dr. Olav Dajani, Linda Falch-Koslung, and the rest of the OUS team that fed me with FOLFIRINOX and kept me alive and in good enough shape to finish this book.</p>
