<span id="decay-app"></span><h1>Models<a class="headerlink" href="#models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This chapter presents many mathematical models that all end up with
ODEs of the type <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=-au+b\)</span>.  The applications are taken from
biology, finance, and physics, and cover population growth or decay,
interacting predator-pray populations, compound interest and
inflation, radioactive decay, chemical and biochemical reaction,
spreading of diseases, cooling of objects, compaction of geological
media, pressure variations in the atmosphere, viscoelastic response in
materials, and air resistance on falling or rising bodies.</p>
<p>Before we turn to the applications, however, we take a brief look at
the technique of scaling, which is so useful in many applications.</p>
<div class="section" id="scaling-1">
<span id="decay-app-scaling"></span><h2>Scaling  (1)<a class="headerlink" href="#scaling-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Real applications of a model <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=-au+b\)</span> will often involve a lot
of parameters in the expressions for <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>. It can be quite
a challenge to find relevant values of all parameters. In simple
problems, however, it turns out that it is not always necessary
to estimate all parameters because we can lump them into one or
a few <em>dimensionless</em> numbers by using a very attractive technique
called scaling. It simply means to stretch the <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(t\)</span> axis
in the present problem - and suddenly all parameters in the problem
are lumped into one parameter if <span class="math">\(b\neq 0\)</span> and no parameter when <span class="math">\(b=0\)</span>!</p>
<div class="section" id="dimensionless-variables">
<h3>Dimensionless variables<a class="headerlink" href="#dimensionless-variables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Scaling means that we introduce a new function <span class="math">\(\bar u(\bar t)\)</span>,
with</p>
<div class="math">
\[\bar u = \frac{u - u_m}{u_c},\quad \bar t = \frac{t}{t_c},\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(u_m\)</span> is a characteristic value of <span class="math">\(u\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u_c\)</span> is a characteristic
size of the range of <span class="math">\(u\)</span> values, and <span class="math">\(t_c\)</span> is a characteristic
size of the range of <span class="math">\(t\)</span> where <span class="math">\(u\)</span> shows significant variation.
Choosing <span class="math">\(u_m\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u_c\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(t_c\)</span> is not always easy and is often an art
in complicated problems. We just state one choice first:</p>
<div class="math">
\[u_c = I,\quad u_m = b/a,\quad t_c = 1/a{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Inserting <span class="math">\(u=u_m + u_c\bar u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(t=t_c\bar t\)</span> in the problem
<span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=-au + b\)</span>, assuming <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> are constants, results (after some
algebra) in the <em>scaled problem</em></p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{d\bar u}{d\bar t} = -\bar u,\quad \bar u(0)=1 - \beta,\]</div>
<p>where</p>
<div class="math">
\[\beta = \frac{b}{Ia}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dimensionless-numbers">
<h3>Dimensionless numbers<a class="headerlink" href="#dimensionless-numbers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The parameter <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> is a dimensionless number. From the equation we
see that <span class="math">\(b\)</span> must have the same unit as the term <span class="math">\(au\)</span>. The initial
condition <span class="math">\(I\)</span> must have the same unit as <span class="math">\(u\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(Ia\)</span> has the same
unit as <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, making the fraction <span class="math">\(b/(Ia)\)</span> dimensionless.</p>
<p>An important observation is that <span class="math">\(\bar u\)</span> depends on <span class="math">\(\bar t\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span>.
That is, only the special combination of <span class="math">\(b/(Ia)\)</span> matters, not what
the individual values of <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(I\)</span> are. The original unscaled
function <span class="math">\(u\)</span> depends on <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(I\)</span>.</p>
<p>A second observation is striking: if <span class="math">\(b=0\)</span>, the scaled problem is
independent of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(I\)</span>! In practice this means that we can perform
a single numerical simulation of the scaled problem and recover the
solution of any problem for a given <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(I\)</span> by stretching the axis
in the plot: <span class="math">\(u=I\bar u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(t =\bar t/a\)</span>.  For <span class="math">\(b\neq 0\)</span>, we
simulate the scaled problem for a few <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> values and recover the
physical solution <span class="math">\(u\)</span> by translating and stretching the <span class="math">\(u\)</span> axis and
stretching the <span class="math">\(t\)</span> axis.</p>
<p>In general, scaling combines the parameters in a problem to a set
of dimensionless parameters. The number of dimensionless parameters is
usually much smaller than the number of original parameters.
The section <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-app-drag"><span class="std std-ref">Vertical motion of a body in a viscous fluid</span></a> presents an example where 11 parameters
are reduced to one!</p>

<div class="section" id="a-scaling-for-vanishing-initial-condition">
<h3>A scaling for vanishing initial condition<a class="headerlink" href="#a-scaling-for-vanishing-initial-condition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The scaling breaks down if <span class="math">\(I=0\)</span>. In that case we may choose <span class="math">\(u_m=0\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(u_c=b/a\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(t_c=1/b\)</span>, resulting in a slightly different scaled problem:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{d\bar u}{d\bar t} = 1 -\bar u,\quad \bar u(0)=0{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>As with <span class="math">\(b=0\)</span>, the case <span class="math">\(I=0\)</span> has a scaled problem with no physical
parameters!</p>
<p>It is common to drop the bars after scaling and write the scaled
problem as <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=-u\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u(0)=1-\beta\)</span>, or <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=1-u\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u(0)=0\)</span>.
Any implementation of the problem <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=-au+b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u(0)=I\)</span>, can be
reused for the scaled problem by setting <span class="math">\(a=1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b=0\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(I=1-\beta\)</span>
in the code, if <span class="math">\(I\neq 0\)</span>, or one sets
<span class="math">\(a=1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b=1\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(I=0\)</span> when the physical <span class="math">\(I\)</span> is zero.
Falling bodies in fluids, as described in the section <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-app-drag"><span class="std std-ref">Vertical motion of a body in a viscous fluid</span></a>,
involves <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=-au+b\)</span> with seven physical parameters. All these vanish
in the scaled version of the problem if we start the motion from rest!</p>
<p>Many more details about scaling is presented in the author&#8217;s book
<em>Scaling of Differential Equations</em> <a class="reference internal" href="._book009.html#ref09" id="id1">[Ref09]</a>.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math">\(N\)</span> be the number of individuals in a population occupying some
spatial domain.  Despite <span class="math">\(N\)</span> being an integer in this problem, we
shall compute with <span class="math">\(N\)</span> as a real number and view <span class="math">\(N(t)\)</span> as a
continuous function of time.  The basic model assumption is that in a
time interval <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> the number of newcomers to the populations
(newborns) is proportional to <span class="math">\(N\)</span>, with proportionality constant <span class="math">\(\bar
b\)</span>. The amount of newcomers will increase the population and result in</p>
<div class="math">
\[N(t+\Delta t) = N(t) + \bar bN(t){\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>It is obvious that a long time interval <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> will result in
more newcomers and hence a larger <span class="math">\(\bar b\)</span>. Therefore, we introduce
<span class="math">\(b=\bar b/\Delta t\)</span>: the number of newcomers per unit time and per
individual. We must then multiply <span class="math">\(b\)</span> by the length of the time
interval considered and by the population size to get the
total number of new individuals, <span class="math">\(b\Delta t N\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the number of removals from the population (deaths) is also
proportional to <span class="math">\(N\)</span>, with proportionality constant <span class="math">\(d\Delta t\)</span>,
the population evolves according to</p>
<div class="math">
\[N(t+\Delta t) = N(t) + b\Delta t N(t) - d\Delta t N(t){\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Dividing by <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> and letting <span class="math">\(\Delta t \rightarrow 0\)</span>,
we get the ODE</p>
<div class="math">
\[N^{\prime} = (b-d)N,\quad N(0)=N_0{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>In a population where the death rate (<span class="math">\(d\)</span>) is larger than
then newborn rate (<span class="math">\(b\)</span>), <span class="math">\(b-d &lt; 0\)</span>, and the population experiences
exponential decay rather than exponential growth.</p>
<p>In some populations there is an immigration of individuals into the
spatial domain. With <span class="math">\(I\)</span> individuals coming in per time unit,
the equation for the population change becomes</p>
<div class="math">
\[N(t+\Delta t) = N(t) + b\Delta t N(t) - d\Delta t N(t) + \Delta t I{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The corresponding ODE reads</p>
<div class="math">
\[N^{\prime} = (b-d)N + I,\quad N(0)=N_0
{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Emigration is also modeled by this <span class="math">\(I\)</span> term if we just change its sign: <span class="math">\(I &lt; 0\)</span>.
So, the <span class="math">\(I\)</span> term models migration in and out of the domain in general.</p>
<p>Some simplification arises if we introduce a fractional measure
of the population: <span class="math">\(u=N/N_0\)</span> and set <span class="math">\(r=b-d\)</span>. The ODE problem
now becomes</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-decay:app:pop:ueq">
<span id="eq-decay-app-pop-ueq"></span><span class="eqno">(1)</span>\[     u^{\prime} = ru + f,\quad u(0)=1,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(f=I/N_0\)</span> measures the net immigration per time unit as
the fraction of the initial population. Very often, <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is approximately
constant, but <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is usually a function of time.</p>

<span id="decay-app-pop-log"></span><h3>Logistic growth<a class="headerlink" href="#logistic-growth" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p id="index-1">The growth rate <span class="math">\(r\)</span> of a population decreases if the environment
has limited resources. Suppose the environment can sustain at
most <span class="math">\(N_{\max}\)</span> individuals. We may then assume that the growth rate

<p>Say the annual interest rate is <span class="math">\(r\)</span> percent and that the bank
adds the interest once a year to your investment.

<p>In reality, the interest rate is added every day. We therefore introduce
a parameter <span class="math">\(m\)</span> for the number of periods per year when the interest

<p>This model is a <em>difference equation</em>, but it can be transformed to a
continuous differential equation through a limit process.
The first step is to derive a formula for the growth of the investment
over a time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>.
Starting with an investment <span class="math">\(u^0\)</span>, and assuming that <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is constant in time,
we get</p>

&amp;\ \ \vdots\\
&amp;= \left(1 +\frac{r}{100 m}\right)^{n+1}u^{0}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Introducing time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, which here is a real-numbered counter for years,

<div class="math">
\[u^{mt} = \left(1 + \frac{r}{100 m}\right)^{mt} u^0{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The second step is to assume <em>continuous compounding</em>, meaning that the
interest is added continuously. This implies <span class="math">\(m\rightarrow\infty\)</span>, and
in the limit one gets the formula</p>

However, the reasoning applies equally well to inflation, which is

One may also take the <span class="math">\(r\)</span> in <a href="#equation-decay:app:interest:eq2">(4)</a>
as the net growth of an investment, where <span class="math">\(r\)</span> takes both compound interest

<p>When a body at some temperature is placed in a cooling environment,
experience shows that the temperature falls rapidly in the beginning,
and then the change in temperature levels off until the body&#8217;s
temperature equals that of the surroundings. Newton carried out some
experiments on cooling hot iron and found that the temperature
evolved as a &#8220;geometric progression at times in arithmetic progression&#8221;,
meaning that the temperature decayed exponentially.
Later, this result was formulated as a differential equation:
the rate of change of the temperature in a body is proportional to
the temperature difference between the body and its surroundings.
This statement is known as <em>Newton&#8217;s law of cooling</em>, which
mathematically can be expressed as</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-decay:Newton:cooling">
<span id="eq-decay-newton-cooling"></span><span class="eqno">(5)</span>\[     {dT\over dt} = -k(T-T_s),\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(T\)</span> is the temperature of the body, <span class="math">\(T_s\)</span> is the temperature
of the surroundings (which may be time-dependent),
<span class="math">\(t\)</span> is time, and <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is a positive constant.
Equation <a href="#equation-decay:Newton:cooling">(5)</a> is primarily viewed as an
empirical law, valid when heat is efficiently convected away
from the surface of the body by a flowing fluid such as air
at constant temperature <span class="math">\(T_s\)</span>.
The <em>heat transfer coefficient</em> <span class="math">\(k\)</span> reflects the transfer of
heat from the body to
the surroundings and must be determined from physical experiments.</p>

<div class="math">

<h3>Stochastic model<a class="headerlink" href="#stochastic-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Originally, we have <span class="math">\(N_0\)</span> atoms. Up to some particular time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, each
atom may either have decayed or not. If not, they have &#8220;survived&#8221;.
We want to count how many original
atoms that have survived.
The survival of a single atom at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is a random event. Since there
are only two outcomes, survival or decay, we have a
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial">Bernoulli trial</a>.
Let <span class="math">\(p\)</span> be the
probability of survival (implying that the probability of decay
is <span class="math">\(1-p\)</span>). If each atom survives independently of
the others, and the probability of survival is the same for every
atom, we have <span class="math">\(N_0\)</span> Bernoulli trials, known as
a <em>binomial experiment</em> from probability theory.
The probability <span class="math">\(P(N)\)</span> that <span class="math">\(N\)</span> out
of the <span class="math">\(N_0\)</span> atoms have survived at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is then given by the
famous <em>binomial distribution</em></p>
<div class="math">
\[P(N) = \frac{N_0!}{N! (N_0-N)!}p^N (1-p)^{N_0-N}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The mean (or expected) value <span class="math">\({\hbox{E}\lbrack P \rbrack}\)</span> of <span class="math">\(P(N)\)</span> is known to be <span class="math">\(N_0p\)</span>.</p>
<p>It remains to estimate <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. Let the interval <span class="math">\([0,t]\)</span> be divided into <span class="math">\(m\)</span>
small subintervals of length <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>. We make the assumption that
the probability of decay of a single atom in an interval of length <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>
is <span class="math">\(\tilde p\)</span>, and that this probability is proportional to <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>:
<span class="math">\(\tilde p = \lambda\Delta t\)</span> (it sounds natural that the probability
of decay increases with <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>). The corresponding probability of survival
is <span class="math">\(1-\lambda\Delta t\)</span>. Believing that <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> is independent
of time, we have, for each interval of length <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>,
a Bernoulli trial: the atom either survives or
decays in that interval. Now, <span class="math">\(p\)</span> should be the probability that the atom
survives in all the intervals, i.e., that we have <span class="math">\(m\)</span> successful
Bernoulli trials in a row and therefore</p>
<div class="math">
\[p = (1-\lambda\Delta t)^m{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The expected number of atoms of the original type at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is</p>
<div class="math">
\[{\hbox{E}\lbrack P \rbrack} = N_0p = N_0(1-\lambda\Delta t)^m,\quad m=t/\Delta t{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>To see the relation between the two types of Bernoulli trials and the
ODE above, we go to the limit <span class="math">\(\Delta t\rightarrow 0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(m\rightarrow\infty\)</span>.
It is possible to show that</p>
<div class="math">
\[p = \lim_{m\rightarrow\infty} (1-\lambda\Delta t)^m
= \lim_{m\rightarrow\infty} \left(1-\lambda\frac{t}{m}\right)^m = e^{-\lambda t}\]</div>
<p>This is the famous exponential waiting time (or arrival time) distribution for a
Poisson process in probability theory (obtained here, as often done, as
the limit of a binomial experiment). The probability of decay, or more
precisely that at least one atom has undergone a transition, is
<span class="math">\(1-p= 1-e^{-\lambda t}\)</span>. This is the
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">exponential distribution</a>.
The limit means that <span class="math">\(m\)</span> is very
large, hence <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> is very small, and <span class="math">\(\tilde p=\lambda\Delta t\)</span>
is very small since the intensity of the events, <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>, is assumed
finite. This situation corresponds to a very small probability
that an atom will decay in a very short time interval, which is a
reasonable model.
The same model occurs in lots of different applications, e.g.,
when waiting for a taxi, or when finding defects along a rope.</p>

is that the ODE model
captures the mean behavior of the underlying stochastic model. This
is, however, not always the common relation between microscopic stochastic
models and macroscopic &#8220;averaged&#8221; models.</p>
<p>Also of interest, is that a Forward Euler discretization of
<span class="math">\(N^{\prime}=-\lambda N\)</span>, <span class="math">\(N(0)=N_0\)</span>, gives <span class="math">\(N^m = N_0(1-\lambda\Delta t)^m\)</span>

decay with probability <span class="math">\(\lambda\Delta t\)</span> in an interval.</p>
<p>A fundamental question is how accurate the ODE model is. The underlying
stochastic model fluctuates around its expected value. A measure
of the fluctuations is the standard deviation of the binomial experiment with
<span class="math">\(N_0\)</span> atoms, which can be shown to be <span class="math">\({\hbox{Std}\lbrack P \rbrack}=\sqrt{N_0p(1-p)}\)</span>. Compared
to the size of the expectation, we get
the normalized standard deviation</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\sqrt{{\hbox{Var}\lbrack P \rbrack}}}{{\hbox{E}\lbrack P \rbrack}} = N_0^{-1/2}\sqrt{p^{-1}-1}

<p>The modeling in the section <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-app-nuclear"><span class="std std-ref">Radioactive decay</span></a> is in fact very
general, despite a focus on a particular physical process. We may
instead of atoms and decay speak about a set of <em>items</em>, where each
item can undergo a stochastic <em>transition</em> from one state to
another. In the section <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-app-kinetics"><span class="std std-ref">Chemical kinetics</span></a> the item is a molecule and
the transition is a chemical reaction, while in the section <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-app-sir"><span class="std std-ref">Spreading of diseases</span></a> the item is an ill person and the transition is
recovering from the illness (or an immune person who loses her
immunity).</p>
<p>From the modeling in the section <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-app-nuclear"><span class="std std-ref">Radioactive decay</span></a> we can establish
a deterministic model for a large number of items and a stochastic
model for an arbitrary number of items, even a single one.
The stochastic model has a parameter <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> reflecting the
probability that a transition takes place in a time interval of
unit length (or equivalently, that the probability is <span class="math">\(\lambda\Delta t\)</span>
for a transition during a time interval of length <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>).
The probability of making a transition before time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is given by</p>
<div class="math">
\[F(t) = 1- e^{-\lambda t}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The corresponding probability density is <span class="math">\(f(t)=F'(t)=e^{-\lambda t}\)</span>.
The expected value of <span class="math">\(F(t)\)</span>, i.e., the expected time to transition,
is <span class="math">\(\lambda^{-1}\)</span>. This interpretation of <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> makes it easy to
measure its value: just carry out a large number of experiments,
measure the time to transition, and take one over the average of these times as

molecules of type A are transformed into molecules of B. This process is,
from a mathematical modeling point of view, equivalent to the

<span id="decay-app-sir"></span><h2>Spreading of diseases<a class="headerlink" href="#spreading-of-diseases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The modeling of spreading of diseases is very similar to the modeling

of epidemiology speaks about susceptibles: people who can get a disease;
infectives: people who are infected and can infect susceptibles; and
recovered: people who have recovered from the disease and
become immune.
Three categories are accordingly defined: S for susceptibles, I for
infectives, and R for recovered. The number in each category is tracked
by the functions <span class="math">\(S(t)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(I(t)\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(R(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>To model how many people that get infected in a small time interval
<span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>, we reason as with reactions in the section <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-app-kinetics"><span class="std std-ref">Chemical kinetics</span></a>.
The possible number of parings (&#8220;collisions&#8221;) between susceptibles
and infected is <span class="math">\(SI\)</span>. A fraction of these, <span class="math">\(\beta\Delta t SI\)</span>,
will actually meet and the infected succeeds of infecting the susceptible,
where <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> is a parameter to be empirically estimated.
This leads to a loss of susceptibles and a gain of infected:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}S(t+\Delta t) &amp;= S(t) - \beta\Delta tSI,\\

<p>In the same time interval, a fraction <span class="math">\(\nu\Delta t I\)</span>
of the infected is recovered.
It follows from the section <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-app-waitingtime"><span class="std std-ref">Generalization of the radioactive decay modeling</span></a>
that the parameter <span class="math">\(\nu^{-1}\)</span> has the interpretation as the average

<span class="target" id="index-5"></span><p id="index-6">A model for the interaction of predator and pray species can be based
on reasoning from population dynamics and the SIR model.
Let <span class="math">\(H(t)\)</span> be the number of prays in a region, and let <span class="math">\(L(t)\)</span>
be the number of predators. For example, <span class="math">\(H\)</span> may be hares and <span class="math">\(L\)</span> lynx,
or rabbits and foxes.</p>
<p>The population of the pray evolvoes due to births and deaths, exactly
as in a population dynamics model from Section
reff{decay:app:pop:exp}.
During a time interval <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>
the increase in the population is therefore</p>
<div class="math">
\[H(t+\Delta t) - H(t) =  a\Delta t H(t),\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is a parameter to be measured.
The increase is proportional to <span class="math">\(H\)</span>, and the proportionality constant
<span class="math">\(a\Delta t\)</span> is proportional to <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>, because doubling the
interval will double the increase.</p>
<p>However, the pray population have an additional loss because they
are eaten by predators. All the pray and predator animals can form
<span class="math">\(LH\)</span> pairs in total (if everybody can meet everybody at random).
A small fraction <span class="math">\(b\Delta t\)</span>
of such meetings, during a time interval <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>,
end up with the predator eating the pray. The increase in the pray
population is therefore adjusted to</p>
<div class="math">
\[H(t+\Delta t) - H(t) =  a\Delta t H(t) - b\Delta t H(t)L(t){\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The predator population increases as a result of eating prays.
The amount of eaten prays is <span class="math">\(b\Delta t LH\)</span>, but only a fraction
<span class="math">\(d\Delta t LH\)</span> of this amount contributes to increasing the
predator population. In addition, predators die and this loss
is set to <span class="math">\(c\Delta t L\)</span>. To summarize, the increase in the predator
population is given by</p>
<div class="math">
\[L(t + \Delta t) - L(t) = d\Delta t L(t)H(t) - c\Delta t L(t){\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Dividing by <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> in the equations for <span class="math">\(H\)</span> and <span class="math">\(L\)</span> and letting
<span class="math">\(t\rightarrow 0\)</span> results in</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\lim_{\Delta t\rightarrow 0}\frac{H(t+\Delta t)-H(t)}{\Delta t}
= H^{\prime}(t) &amp;= aH(t) - bL(t)H(t),\\
\lim_{\Delta t\rightarrow 0}\frac{L(t+\Delta t)-L(t)}{\Delta t}

<p>Sediments, originally made from materials like sand and mud, get
compacted through geological time by the weight of new material that
is deposited on the sea bottom. The porosity <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> of the sediments
tells how much void (fluid) space there is between the sand and
mud grains. The porosity drops with depth, due to the weight of
the sediments above. This makes the void space shrink, and thereby compaction
increases.</p>
<p>A typical assumption is that the change in <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> at some depth <span class="math">\(z\)</span>
is negatively proportional to <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span>. This assumption leads to
the differential equation problem</p>

layer number <span class="math">\(i\)</span>, we have the unknown porosity function <span class="math">\(\phi_i(z)\)</span>
fulfilling <span class="math">\(\phi_i^{\prime}(z)=-c_iz\)</span>, since the constant <span class="math">\(c\)</span> in the model

<p>A body moving vertically through a fluid (liquid or gas) is subject to
three different types of forces: the gravity force, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)">the drag force</a>,
and the buoyancy force.</p>
<div class="section" id="overview-of-forces">
<h3>Overview of forces<a class="headerlink" href="#overview-of-forces" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Taking the upward direction as positive,
the gravity force is <span class="math">\(F_g= -mg\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(m\)</span> is the mass of the body and
<span class="math">\(g\)</span> is the acceleration of gravity.
The uplift or buoyancy force (&#8220;Archimedes force&#8221;) is <span class="math">\(F_b = \varrho gV\)</span>,
where <span class="math">\(\varrho\)</span> is the density of the fluid and
<span class="math">\(V\)</span> is the volume of the body.</p>
<p>The drag force is of two types, depending on the Reynolds number</p>
<div class="math">
\[\hbox{Re} = \frac{\varrho d|v|}{\mu},\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(d\)</span> is the diameter of the body in
the direction perpendicular to the flow, <span class="math">\(v\)</span> is the velocity of the
body, and <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.
When <span class="math">\(\hbox{Re} &lt; 1\)</span>, the drag force is fairly well modeled by
the so-called Stokes&#8217; drag,
which for a spherical body of diameter <span class="math">\(d\)</span> reads</p>
<div class="math">
\[F_d^{(S)} = - 3\pi d\mu v
{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Quantities are taken as positive in the upwards vertical direction, so
if <span class="math">\(v&gt;0\)</span> and the body moves upwards, the drag force acts downwards and
become negative, in accordance with the minus sign in expression for
<span class="math">\(F_d^{(S)}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For large Re, typically <span class="math">\(\hbox{Re} &gt; 10^3\)</span>, the drag force is quadratic
in the velocity:</p>
<div class="math">
\[F_d^{(q)} = -{1\over2}C_D\varrho A|v|v,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(C_D\)</span> is a dimensionless drag coefficient depending on the body&#8217;s shape,
and <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is the cross-sectional area as
produced by a cut plane, perpendicular to the motion, through the thickest
part of the body. The superscripts <span class="math">\(\,{}^q\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\,{}^S\)</span> in
<span class="math">\(F_d^{(S)}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(F_d^{(q)}\)</span> indicate Stokes drag and quadratic drag,

and <span class="math">\(8.9\cdot 10^{-4}\hbox{ Pa}\, \hbox{s}\)</span> for water.
Densities can be taken as <span class="math">\(1.2\hbox{ kg/m}^3\)</span> for air and as
<span class="math">\(1.0\cdot 10^3\hbox{ kg/m}^3\)</span> for water. For considerable vertical
displacement in the atmosphere one should take into account that
the density of air varies with the altitude, see the section <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-app-atm"><span class="std std-ref">Decay of atmospheric pressure with altitude</span></a>.
One possible density variation arises from the one-layer model
in the mentioned section.</p>
<p>Any density variation makes <span class="math">\(b\)</span> time dependent and we need
<span class="math">\(b^{n+\frac{1}{2}}\)</span> in <a href="#equation-decay:app:fallingbody:gmodel:q:CN">(25)</a>.
To compute the density that enters
<span class="math">\(b^{n+\frac{1}{2}}\)</span> we must also compute the vertical

difference approximation:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{z^{n+\frac{1}{2}} - z^{n-\frac{1}{2}}}{\Delta t} = v^n

<p>This <span class="math">\(z^{n+\frac{1}{2}}\)</span> is used in the expression for <span class="math">\(b\)</span>

for a semi-sphere, 1.05 for a cube, 0.82 for a long cylinder (when the
center axis is in the vertical direction), 0.75 for a rocket,
1.0-1.3 for a man in upright position, 1.3 for a flat plate perpendicular
to the flow, and
0.04 for a streamlined, droplet-like body.</p>

<p>To verify the program, one may assume a heavy body in air such that the <span class="math">\(F_b\)</span>

air resistance <span class="math">\(F_d\)</span> can also be neglected. This can be obtained by
setting <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\varrho\)</span> to zero. The motion then leads to
the velocity
<span class="math">\(v(t)=v_0 - gt\)</span>, which is linear in <span class="math">\(t\)</span> and therefore should be
reproduced to machine precision (say tolerance <span class="math">\(10^{-15}\)</span>) by any
implementation based on the Crank-Nicolson or Forward Euler schemes.</p>
<p>Another verification, but not as powerful as the one above,
can be based on computing the terminal velocity and comparing with
the exact expressions.
The advantage of this verification is that we can also
test the situation <span class="math">\(\varrho\neq 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>As always, the method of manufactured solutions can be applied to
test the implementation of all terms in the governing equation, but

<span class="target" id="index-11"></span><p id="index-12">When stretching a rod made of a perfectly elastic material, the
elongation (change in the rod&#8217;s
length) is proportional to the magnitude of the applied force.
Mathematical models for material behavior under application of
external forces use <em>strain</em> <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>
and <em>stress</em> <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> instead of elongation and
forces. Strain is relative change in elongation and stress is force
per unit area. An elastic material has a linear relation between
stress and strain:  <span class="math">\(\sigma = E\varepsilon\)</span>. This is a good model
for many materials, but frequently the velocity of the deformation
(or more precisely, the strain rate <span class="math">\(\varepsilon^{\prime}\)</span>)
also influences the stress. This is particularly the case for
materials like organic polymers, rubber, and wood. When the stress
depends on both the strain and the strain rate, the material is
said to be viscoelastic. A common model relating forces to deformation
is the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin-Voigt_material">Kelvin-Vogt model</a>:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-decay:app:viscoelasticity:se">

<p>Compared to a perfectly elastic material, which deforms instantaneously
when a force is acting, a Kelvin-Vogt material will spend some time
to elongate. For example, when an elastic rod is subject to a constant
force <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\)</span> at <span class="math">\(t=0\)</span>, the strain immediately adjusts to <span class="math">\(\varepsilon
=\sigma/E\)</span>. A Kelvin-Vogt material, however, has a response
<span class="math">\(\varepsilon(t) = \frac{sigma}{E}(1-e^{Et/\eta})\)</span>. Removing the force
when the strain is <span class="math">\(\varepsilon(t_1) = I\)</span> will for an elastic material
immediately bring the strain back to zero, while a Kelvin-Vogt
material will decay: <span class="math">\(\varepsilon = Ie^{-(t-t_1)E/\eta)}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Introducing <span class="math">\(u\)</span> for <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> and treating <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{\sigma}(t)\)</span> as a
given function, we can write the Kelvin-Vogt model in our standard form</p>
<div class="math">

<p>with <span class="math">\(a = E/\eta\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b(t)=\boldsymbol{\sigma}(t)/\eta\)</span>. An initial condition,

<p>Suppose we have a partial differential equation</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}
+ f(x,t),\]</div>
<p>with boundary conditions <span class="math">\(u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0\)</span> and initial condition
<span class="math">\(u(x,0)=I(x)\)</span>. One may express the solution as</p>
<div class="math">
\[u(x,t) = \sum_{k=1}^m A_k(t)e^{ikx\pi/L},\]</div>
<p>for appropriate unknown functions <span class="math">\(A_k\)</span>, <span class="math">\(k=1,\ldots,m\)</span>.
We use the complex exponential <span class="math">\(e^{ikx\pi/L}\)</span> for easy algebra, but
the physical <span class="math">\(u\)</span> is taken as the real part of any complex expression.
Note that the expansion in terms of <span class="math">\(e^{ikx\pi/L}\)</span> is compatible with
the boundary conditions: all functions <span class="math">\(e^{ikx\pi/L}\)</span> vanish for
<span class="math">\(x=0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x=L\)</span>. Suppose we can express <span class="math">\(I(x)\)</span> as</p>
<div class="math">
\[I(x) = \sum_{k=1}^m I_ke^{ikx\pi/L}
{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Such an expansion can be computed by well-known Fourier expansion techniques,
but those details are not important here.
Also, suppose we can express the given <span class="math">\(f(x,t)\)</span> as</p>
<div class="math">
\[f(x,t) = \sum_{k=1}^m b_k(t)e^{ikx\pi/L}
{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Inserting the expansions for <span class="math">\(u\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(f\)</span> in the differential equations demands that all terms corresponding
to a given <span class="math">\(k\)</span> must be equal. The calculations result in the follow
system of ODEs:</p>
<div class="math">
\[A_k^{\prime}(t) = -\alpha\frac{k^2\pi^2}{L^2} + b_k(t),\quad k=1,\ldots,m
{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>From the initial condition</p>
<div class="math">
\[u(x,0)=\sum_k A_k(0)e^{ikx\pi/L}=I(x)=\sum_k I_k e^{(ikx\pi/L)},\]</div>
<p>so it follows that <span class="math">\(A_k(0)=I_k\)</span>, <span class="math">\(k=1,\ldots,m\)</span>. We then have <span class="math">\(m\)</span>
equations of the form <span class="math">\(A_k^{\prime}=-a A_k +b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(A_k(0)=I_k\)</span>, for
appropriate definitions of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>. These ODE problems
are independent of each other such that we can solve one problem
at a time. The outlined technique is a quite common solution approach to
partial differential equations.</p>
<p><strong>Remark.</strong>
Since <span class="math">\(a_k\)</span> depends on <span class="math">\(k\)</span> and the stability of the
Forward Euler scheme demands <span class="math">\(a_k\Delta t \leq 1\)</span>, we get that <span class="math">\(\Delta
t \leq \alpha^{-1}L^2\pi^{-2} k^{-2}\)</span> for this scheme.  Usually, quite
large <span class="math">\(k\)</span> values are needed to accurately represent the given
functions <span class="math">\(I\)</span> and <span class="math">\(f\)</span> so that <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> in the Forward Euler scheme
needs to be very small for these large values of <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.  Therefore, the
Crank-Nicolson and Backward Euler schemes, which allow larger <span class="math">\(\Delta

creating time-stepping algorithms for partial differential equations
of the type considered in this example.</p>

Find an expression for the exact solution of

<p>Find a value of the time step

<span id="decay-app-exer-parachute"></span><h3>Project 30: Simulate parachuting<a class="headerlink" href="#project-30-simulate-parachuting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The aim of this project is to develop a general solver for the
vertical motion of a body with quadratic air drag, verify the solver,
apply the solver to a skydiver in free fall, and finally apply the
solver to a complete parachute jump.</p>
<p>All the pieces of software implemented in this project should be
realized as Python functions and/or classes and collected in one
module.</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong>
Set up the differential equation problem that governs the velocity
of the motion.
The parachute jumper is subject to the gravity force and a quadratic
drag force. Assume constant density.
Add an extra source term be used for program verification.
Identify the input data to the problem.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong>
Make a Python module for computing the velocity of the motion.
Also equip the module with functionality for plotting the velocity.</p>
<p><strong>Hint 1.</strong>
Use the Crank-Nicolson scheme with a geometric mean of <span class="math">\(|v|v\)</span> in time to
linearize the equation of motion with quadratic drag.</p>
<p><strong>Hint 2.</strong>
You can either use functions or classes for implementation.
If you choose functions, make a function
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">solver</span></code> that takes all the input data in the problem as
arguments and that returns the velocity (as a mesh function) and
the time mesh. In case of a class-based implementation, introduce
a problem class with the physical data
and a solver class with the numerical data and a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">solve</span></code> method
that stores the velocity and the mesh in the class.</p>
<p>Allow for a time-dependent area and drag coefficient in the
formula for the drag force.</p>
<p><strong>c)</strong>
Show that a linear function of <span class="math">\(t\)</span> does not fulfill the discrete
equations because of the geometric mean approximation
used for the quadratic drag
term.  Fit a source term, as in the method of manufactured solutions,
such that a linear function of <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is a solution of the discrete
equations. Make a test function to check that this solution is reproduced
to machine precision.</p>
<p><strong>d)</strong>
The expected error in this problem goes like <span class="math">\(\Delta t^2\)</span> because we
use a centered finite difference approximation with error <span class="math">\({\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2)}\)</span>
and a geometric mean approximation with error <span class="math">\({\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2)}\)</span>.
Use the method of manufactured solutions combined with computing
convergence rate to verify the code. Make a test function for checking
that the convergence rate is correct.</p>
<p><strong>e)</strong>
Compute the drag force, the gravity
force, and the buoyancy force as a function of time. Create
a plot with these three forces.</p>
<p><strong>Hint.</strong>
You can either make a function <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">forces(v,</span> <span class="pre">t,</span> <span class="pre">plot=None)</span></code>
that returns the forces (as mesh functions) and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">t</span></code>, and shows
a plot on the screen and also saves the plot to a file with name
stored in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plot</span></code>
if <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plot</span></code> is not <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">None</span></code>, or you can extend the solver class with
computation of forces and include plotting of forces in the
visualization class.</p>
<p><strong>f)</strong>
Compute the velocity of
a skydiver in free fall before the parachute opens.</p>
<p><strong>Hint.</strong>
Meade and Struthers <a class="reference internal" href="._book009.html#ref10" id="id2">[Ref10]</a> provide some data relevant
to <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachuting">skydiving</a>.
The mass of the human body and equipment
can be set to <span class="math">\(100\)</span> kg.
A skydiver in spread-eagle formation has a cross-section of 0.5 <span class="math">\(\hbox{m}^2\)</span>
in the horizontal plane.
The density of air decreases varies altitude, but can be taken
as constant, 1 <span class="math">\(\hbox{kg/m}^3\)</span>, for altitudes relevant to
skydiving (0-4000 m).
The drag coefficient for a man in upright position can be set to 1.2.
Start with a zero velocity.
A free fall typically has a terminating velocity of 45 m/s. (This value
can be used to tune other parameters.)</p>
<p><strong>g)</strong>
The next task is to simulate
a parachute jumper during free fall and after the parachute opens.
At time <span class="math">\(t_p\)</span>, the parachute opens and
the drag coefficient and the cross-sectional
area change dramatically.
Use the program to simulate a jump from <span class="math">\(z=3000\)</span> m to the ground <span class="math">\(z=0\)</span>.
What is the maximum acceleration, measured in units of <span class="math">\(g\)</span>,
experienced by the jumper?</p>
<p><strong>Hint.</strong>
Following Meade and Struthers <a class="reference internal" href="._book009.html#ref10" id="id3">[Ref10]</a>, one can set the
cross-section area perpendicular to the motion to 44 <span class="math">\(\hbox{m}^2\)</span>
when the parachute is open. Assume that it takes 8 s to increase
the area linearly from the original to the final value.
The drag coefficient for an open
parachute can be taken as 1.8, but tuned using the known value
of the typical terminating velocity reached before landing:
5.3 m/s. One can take the drag coefficient as a piecewise constant
function with an abrupt change at <span class="math">\(t_p\)</span>.
The parachute is typically released after <span class="math">\(t_p=60\)</span> s, but
larger values of <span class="math">\(t_p\)</span> can be used to make plots more illustrative.</p>
