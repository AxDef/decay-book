Automating scientific experiments
=================================

Empirical scientific investigations based on running computer programs
require careful design of the experiments and accurate reporting of results.
Although there is a strong tradition to do such investigations manually,
the extreme requirements to scientific accuracy make a program much
better suited to conduct the experiments. We shall in this section outline
how we can write such programs, often called *scripts*, for running other
programs and archiving the results.


.. admonition:: Scientific investigation

   The purpose of the investigations is to explore the quality of numerical
   solutions to an ordinary differential equation. More specifically, we
   solve the initial-value problem
   
   .. _Eq:softeng1:experiments:model:

.. math::
   :label: softeng1:experiments:model
           
           u^\prime(t) = -au(t),\quad u(0)=I,\quad t\in (0,T],
           
           
   
   by the :math:`\theta`-rule:
   
   .. _Eq:softeng1:experiments:theta:

.. math::
   :label: softeng1:experiments:theta
           
           u^{n+1} = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}u^n,
           \quad u^0=I{\thinspace .}
           
           
   
   This scheme corresponds to well-known methods: :math:`\theta=0` gives the
   Forward Euler (FE) scheme, :math:`\theta=1` gives the Backward Euler (BE) scheme,
   and :math:`\theta=\frac{1}{2}` gives the Crank-Nicolson
   (CN) or midpoint/centered scheme.
   
   For chosen constants :math:`I`, :math:`a`, and :math:`T`, we run the three schemes for various
   values of :math:`\Delta t`, and present the following results in a report:
   
   1. visual comparison of the numerical and exact solution in a plot for
      each :math:`\Delta t` and :math:`\theta=0,1,\frac{1}{2}`,
   
   2. a table and a plot of the norm of the numerical error versus :math:`\Delta t`
      for :math:`\theta=0,1,\frac{1}{2}`.
   
   The report will also document the mathematical details of the problem under
   investigation.




Available software
------------------

Appropriate software for implementing :eq:`softeng1:experiments:theta`
is available in a program `model.py <http://tinyurl.com/nc4upel/doconce_src/model.py>`__, which is run as

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> python model.py --I 1.5 --a 0.25 --T 6 --dt 1.25 0.75 0.5

The command-line input corresponds to setting :math:`I=1.5`, :math:`a=0.25`, :math:`T=6`,
and run three values of :math:`\Delta t`: 1.25, 0.75, ad 0.5.

The results of running this ``model.py`` command are text in the
terminal window and a set of plot files.
The plot files have names ``M_D.E``, where ``M`` denotes the method
(``FE``, ``BE``, ``CN`` for :math:`\theta=0,1,\frac{1}{2}`, respectively), ``D``
the time step length (here ``1.25``, ``0.75``, or ``0.5``), and ``E``
is the plot file extension ``png`` or ``pdf``.
The text output in the terminal window looks like

.. code-block:: text

        0.0   1.25:    5.998E-01
        0.0   0.75:    1.926E-01
        0.0   0.50:    1.123E-01
        0.0   0.10:    1.558E-02
        0.5   1.25:    6.231E-02
        0.5   0.75:    1.543E-02
        0.5   0.50:    7.237E-03
        0.5   0.10:    2.469E-04
        1.0   1.25:    1.766E-01
        1.0   0.75:    8.579E-02
        1.0   0.50:    6.884E-02
        1.0   0.10:    1.411E-02

The first column is the :math:`\theta` value, the next the :math:`\Delta t` value,
and the final column represents the numerical error :math:`E` (the
norm of discrete error function on the mesh).

The results we want to produce
------------------------------

The results we need for our investigations are slightly different than
what is directly produced by ``model.py``:

1. We need to collect all the plots for one
   numerical method (FE, BE, CN) in a single plot.
   For example, if 4 :math:`\Delta t` values are run, the summarizing plot
   for the BE method has :math:`2\times 2` subplots, with the subplot corresponding
   to the largest :math:`\Delta t` in the upper left corner and the smallest
   in the bottom right corner.

2. We need to create a table containing
   :math:`\Delta t` values in the first column and the numerical error
   :math:`E` for :math:`\theta=0,0.5,1`
   in the next three columns. This table should be available as a
   standard CSV file.

3. We need to plot the numerical error :math:`E` versus :math:`\Delta t`
   in a log-log plot.

Consequently, we must write a script that can run ``model.py`` as described and
produce the results 1-3 above. This requires combining multiple plot files into
one file and interpreting the output from ``model.py`` as data for plotting and
file storage.

If the script's name is ``exper1.py``, we run it with the desired :math:`\Delta t`
values as positional command-line arguments:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> python exper1.py 0.5 0.25 0.1 0.05

This run will then generate eight plot files: ``FE.png`` and ``FE.pdf`` summarizing
the plots with the FE method, ``BE.png`` and ``BE.pdf`` with
the BE method, ``CN.png`` and ``CN.pdf`` with the CN method, and ``error.png``
and ``error.pdf`` with the log-log plot of the numerical error versus :math:`\Delta t`.
In addition, the table with numerical errors is written to a
file ``error.csv``.

.. index:: reproducibility

.. index:: replicability


.. admonition:: Reproducible and replicable science

   A script that automates running our computer experiments
   will ensure
   that the experiments can easily be rerun by anyone in
   the future, either to confirm the same results or redo the experiments with
   other input data.
   Also, whatever we did to produce the results is
   documented in every detail in the script.
   
   A project where anyone can easily repeat the experiments with the same data
   is referred to as being *replicable*, and replicability
   should be a fundamental requirement in scientific computing work.
   Of more scientific interest is *reproducibilty*, which means that we can
   also run alternative experiments to arrive at the same conclusions.
   This requires more than an automating script.




Combining plot files
--------------------

The script for running experiments needs to combine multiple image
files into one. The
`montage <http://www.imagemagick.org/script/montage.php>`__
and
`convert <http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php>`__ programs in
the ImageMagick software suite
can be used to combine image files.
However, these programs are best suited for
PNG files. For vector plots in PDF format one needs other tools
to preserve the quality: ``pdftk``, ``pdfnup``, and ``pdfcrop``.

Suppose you have four files ``f1.png``, ``f2.png``, ``f3.png``, and ``f4.png``
and want to combine them into a :math:`2\times 2` table of subplots in a new
file ``f.png``, see
Figure :ref:`softeng1:experiments:fig:BE4a` for an example.

.. _softeng1:experiments:fig:BE4a:

.. figure:: BE4a.png
   :width: 600

   *Illustration of the Backward Euler method for four time step values*

The appropriate ImageMagick commands are

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> montage -background white -geometry 100% -tile 2x \ 
                  f1.png f2.png f3.png f4.png f.png
        Terminal> convert -trim f.png f.png
        Terminal> convert f.png -transparent white f.png

The first command mounts the four files in one, the next ``convert`` command
removes unnecessary surrounding white space, and the final ``convert`` command
makes the white background transparent.

High-quality montage of PDF files ``f1.pdf``,
``f2.pdf``, ``f3.pdf``, and ``f4.pdf`` into ``f.pdf`` goes like

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> pdftk f1.pdf f2.pdf f3.pdf f4.pdf output tmp.pdf
        Terminal> pdfnup --nup 2x2 --outfile tmp.pdf tmp.pdf
        Terminal> pdfcrop tmp.pdf f.pdf
        Terminal> rm -f tmp.pdf

Running a program from Python
-----------------------------

The script for automating experiments needs to run the ``model.py`` program
with appropriate command-line options. Python has several tools for
executing an arbitrary command in the operating systems.
Let ``cmd`` be a string containing the desired command.
In the present case study, ``cmd`` could be ``'python model.py --I 1 --dt 0.5 0.2'``.
The following code
executes ``cmd`` and loads the text output into a string ``output``:

.. code-block:: python

        from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, STDOUT
        p = Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdout=PIPE, stderr=STDOUT)
        output, _ = p.communicate()
        
        # Check if the execution was successful
        failure = p.returncode
        if failure:
            print 'Command failed:', cmd; sys.exit(1)

Unsuccessful execution usually makes it meaningless to continue
the program, and therefore we abort the program with ``sys.exit(1)``.
Any argument different from 0 signifies to the computer's operating system
that our program stopped with a failure.


.. admonition:: Programming tip: use ``_`` for dummy variable

   Sometimes we need to unpack tuples or lists in separate variables,
   but we are not interested in all the variables. One example is
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           output, error = p.communicate()
   
   but ``error`` is of no interest.
   One can then use underscore ``_`` as variable name for the dummy
   (uninteresting) variable(s):
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           output, _ = p.communicate()
   
   Here is another example where we iterate over a list of three-tuples,
   but the interest is limited to the second element in each three-tuple:
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           for _, value, _ in list_of_three_tuples:
               # work with value




We need to interpret the contents of the string
``output`` and store
the data in an appropriate data structure for further processing.
Since the content is basically a table and will be transformed to
a spread sheet format, we let the columns in the table be represented
by lists in the program,
and we collect these columns in a dictionary whose keys are natural
column names: ``dt`` and the three values of :math:`\theta`.
The following code translates the output of ``cmd`` (``output``)
to such a dictionary of lists (``errors``):

.. code-block:: python

        errors = {'dt': dt_values, 1: [], 0: [], 0.5: []}
        for line in output.splitlines():
            words = line.split()
            if words[0] in ('0.0', '0.5', '1.0'):  # line with E?
                # typical line: 0.0   1.25:    7.463E+00
                theta = float(words[0])
                E = float(words[2])
                errors[theta].append(E)

The automating script
---------------------

We have now all the core elements in place to write the complete
script where we run
``model.py`` for a set of :math:`\Delta t` values (given as positional
command-line arguments), make the error plot,
write the CSV file, and combine plot files as described above.
The complete code is listed below, followed by some explaining comments.

.. code-block:: python

        import os, sys, glob
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        
        def run_experiments(I=1, a=2, T=5):
            # The command line must contain dt values
            if len(sys.argv) > 1:
                dt_values = [float(arg) for arg in sys.argv[1:]]
            else:
                print 'Usage: %s dt1 dt2 dt3 ...' %  sys.argv[0]
                sys.exit(1)  # abort
        
            # Run module file and grab output
            cmd = 'python model.py --I %g --a %g --T %g' % (I, a, T)
            dt_values_str = ' '.join([str(v) for v in dt_values])
            cmd += ' --dt %s' % dt_values_str
            print cmd
            from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, STDOUT
            p = Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdout=PIPE, stderr=STDOUT)
            output, _ = p.communicate()
            failure = p.returncode
            if failure:
                print 'Command failed:', cmd; sys.exit(1)
        
            errors = {'dt': dt_values, 1: [], 0: [], 0.5: []}
            for line in output.splitlines():
                words = line.split()
                if words[0] in ('0.0', '0.5', '1.0'):  # line with E?
                    # typical line: 0.0   1.25:    7.463E+00

            # Find min/max for the axis
            E_min = 1E+20; E_max = -E_min
            for theta in 0, 0.5, 1:
                E_min = min(E_min, min(errors[theta]))
                E_max = max(E_max, max(errors[theta]))

            f.write(r'$\Delta t$,$\theta=0$,$\theta=0.5$,$\theta=1$' + '\n')
            for _dt, _fe, _cn, _be in zip(

We may comment upon many useful constructs in this script:

 * ``[float(arg) for arg in sys.argv[1:]]`` builds a list of real numbers
   from all the command-line arguments.

 * ``['%s_%s.png' % (method, dt) for dt in dt_values]`` builds a list of
   filenames from a list of numbers (``dt_values``).

 * All ``montage``, ``convert``, ``pdftk``, ``pdfnup``, and ``pdfcrop``
   commands for creating
   composite figures are stored in a
   list and later executed in a loop.

 * ``glob('*_*.png')`` returns a list of the names of all files in the
   current directory where the filename matches the `Unix wildcard notation <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>`__
   ``*_*.png`` (meaning any text, underscore, any text, and then ``.png``).

 * ``os.remove(filename)`` removes the file with name ``filename``.

 * ``failure = os.system(cmd)`` runs an operating system command with
   simpler syntax than what is required by ``subprocess`` (but the output
   of ``cmd`` cannot be captured).

Making a report
---------------

The results of running computer experiments are best documented in a
little report containing the problem to be solved, key code segments,
and the plots from a series of experiments. At least the part of the
report containing the plots should be automatically generated by the
script that performs the set of experiments, because in the script we
know exactly which input data that were used to generate a specific
plot, thereby ensuring that each figure is connected to the
right data. Take a look at `a sample report <http://tinyurl.com/nc4upel/_static/sphinx-cloud/>`__  to see what we have in
mind.

Word, OpenOffice, GoogleDocs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Microsoft Word, its open source counterparts OpenOffice and
LibreOffice, along with GoogleDocs and similar online services are the
dominating tools for writing reports today. Nevertheless, scientific
reports often need mathematical equations and nicely typeset computer
code in monospace font. The support for mathematics and computer code
in the mentioned tools is in this author's view not on par with the
technologies based on *markup languages* and which are addressed
below. Also, with markup languages one has a readable, pure text file
as source for the report, and changes in this text can easily be
tracked by version control systems like Git. The result is a very
strong tool for monitoring "who did what when" with the files,
resulting in increased reliability of the writing process. For
collaborative writing, the merge functionality in Git leads to safer
simultaneously editing that what is offered even by collaborative
tools like GoogleDocs.

.. index:: MathJax

HTML with MathJax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HTML is the markup language used for web pages.  Nicely typeset computer
code is straightforward in HTML, and high-quality mathematical
typesetting is available using an extension to HTML called `MathJax <http://www.mathjax.org/>`__, which allows formulas and equations to be
typeset with LaTeX syntax and nicely rendered in web browsers, see
Figure :ref:`softeng1:exper:report:fig:mathjax`.  A relatively small
subset of LaTeX environments for mathematics is supported, but the
syntax for formulas is quite rich. Inline formulas look like ``\(
u'=-au \)`` while equations are surrounded by ``$$`` signs.  Inside such
signs, one can use ``\[ u'=-au \]`` for unnumbered equations, or
``\begin{equation}`` and ``\end{equation}`` for
numbered equations, or ``\begin{equation}`` and ``\end{equation}`` for multiple
numbered aligned equations.  You need to be familiar with `mathematical
typesetting in LaTeX <http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics>`__ to write MathJax
code.

The file `exper1_mathjax.py <http://tinyurl.com/p96acy2/report_generation/exper1_html.py>`__
calls a script
`exper1.py <http://tinyurl.com/p96acy2/exper1.py>`__
to perform the numerical experiments and then runs Python
statements for creating an `HTML file <http://tinyurl.com/nc4upel/_static/report_mathjax.html.html>`__ with the source code for `the scientific report <http://tinyurl.com/nc4upel/_static/report_mathjax.html>`__.

LaTeX
~~~~~

.. "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX"

The *de facto* language for mathematical typesetting and scientific
report writing is `LaTeX <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX>`__. A
number of very sophisticated packages have been added to the language
over a period of three decades, allowing very fine-tuned layout and
typesetting. For output in the `PDF format <http://tinyurl.com/nc4upel/_static/report.pdf>`__, see Figure
:ref:`softeng1:exper:report:fig:latex` for an example, LaTeX is the
definite choice when it comes to *typesetting quality*.
The LaTeX language used to
write the reports has typically a lot of commands involving
`backslashes and braces <http://tinyurl.com/nc4upel/_static/report.tex.html>`__, and many claim that
LaTeX syntax is not particularly readable.  For output on the web via
HTML code (i.e., not only showing the PDF in the browser window), LaTeX
struggles with delivering high quality typesetting. Other tools,
especially Sphinx, give better results and can also produce
nice-looking PDFs.  The file `exper1_latex.py <http://tinyurl.com/p96acy2/report_generation/exper1_latex.py>`__ shows how to
generate the LaTeX source from a program.

`Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`__ is a typesetting language with
similarities to HTML and LaTeX, but with much less tagging. It has
recently become very popular for software documentation and
mathematical reports. Sphinx can utilize LaTeX for mathematical
formulas and equations. Unfortunately, the
subset of LaTeX mathematics supported is less than in full MathJax (in
particular, numbering of multiple equations in an ``align`` type
environment is not supported).  The `Sphinx syntax <http://tinyurl.com/nc4upel/_static/report_sphinx.rst.html>`__ is an extension of
the reStructuredText language. An attractive feature of Sphinx is its
rich support for `fancy layout of web pages <http://tinyurl.com/nc4upel/_static/sphinx-cloud/index.html>`__. In particular,
Sphinx can easily be combined with various layout *themes* that give a
certain look and feel to the web site and that offers table of
contents, navigation, and search facilities, see Figure
:ref:`softeng1:exper:report:fig:sphinx`.

.. index:: Markdown

Markdown
~~~~~~~~

A recent, very popular format for easy writing of web pages is
`Markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`__.
Text is written very much like one would do in email, using
spacing and special characters to naturally format the code
instead of heavily tagging the text as in LaTeX and HTML.
With the tool `Pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`__ one
can go from Markdown to a variety of formats.
HTML is a common output format, but LaTeX, epub, XML,
OpenOffice/LibreOffice, MediaWiki, and Microsoft Word are some other
possibilities. A Markdown version of our scientific
report demo is available as an IPython/Jupyter notebook (described next).

.. index:: IPython notebooks

.. index:: Jupyter notebooks

IPython/Jupyter notebooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `IPython Notebook <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`__ is
a web-based tool where one can write scientific reports with live computer
code and graphics. Or the other way around: software can be equipped
with documentation in the style of scientific reports.
A slightly extended version of Markdown is used for writing text and
mathematics, and the `source code of a notebook <http://tinyurl.com/nc4upel/_static/report.ipynb.html>`__ is in json format.
The interest in the notebook has grown amazingly fast
over just a few years, and further development now takes place
in the `Jupyter project <https://jupyter.org/>`__, which
supports a lot of programming languages for interactive notebook computing.
Jupyter notebooks are primarily live electronic documents, but they can be
printed out as PDF reports too.
A notebook version of our scientific report can be `downloaded <http://tinyurl.com/p96acy2/_static/report.ipynb>`__ and experimented with
or `just statically viewed <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/hplgit.github.com/teamods/writing_reports/_static/report.ipynb>`__ in a browser.

Wiki formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A range of wiki formats are popular for creating notes on the web,
especially documents which allow groups of people to edit and add
content. Apart from `MediaWiki <http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki>`__ (the wiki format used for
Wikipedia), wiki formats have no support for mathematical typesetting
and also limited tools for displaying computer code in nice ways.
Wiki formats are therefore less suitable for scientific reports compared
to the other formats mentioned here.

.. index:: DocOnce

DocOnce
~~~~~~~

Since it is difficult to choose the right tool or format for writing a
scientific report, it is advantageous to write the content in a format
that easily translates to LaTeX, HTML, Sphinx, Markdown,
IPython/Jupyter notebooks, and various wikis. `DocOnce <https://github.com/hplgit/doconce>`__ is such a tool. It is similar to
Pandoc, but offers some special convenient features for writing about
mathematics and programming.  The `tagging is modest <http://tinyurl.com/nc4upel/_static/report.do.txt.html>`__, somewhere between
LaTeX and Markdown.  The program `exper1_do.py <http://tinyurl.com/p96acy2/exper1_do.py>`__ demonstrates how
to generate DocOnce code for a scientific report.
There is also a corresponding rich demo of the `resulting reports <http://tinyurl.com/nc4upel/index.html>`__ that can be made from
this DocOnce code.

Publishing a complete project
-----------------------------

.. index:: replicability

To assist the important principle of *replicable* science,
a report documenting scientific investigations should be accompanied by
all the software and data used for the investigations so that others
have a possibility to redo the work and assess the qualify of the results.

One way of documenting a complete project is to make a directory tree
with all relevant files. Preferably, the tree is published at
some project hosting site like `Bitbucket or GitHub <http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/bitgit/html/>`__ so that others can download it
as a tarfile, zipfile, or clone the files directly using the Git version control
system.
For the investigations outlined in the section :ref:`softeng1:exper:report`,
we can create a directory tree with files

.. code-block:: text

        setup.py
        ./src:
           model.py
        ./doc:
           ./src:
              exper1_mathjax.py
              make_report.sh
              run.sh
           ./pub:
              report.html

The ``src`` directory holds source code (modules) to be reused in other projects,
the ``setup.py`` script builds and installs such software,
the ``doc`` directory contains the documentation, with ``src`` for the
source of the documentation (usually written in a markup language)
and ``pub`` for published (compiled) documentation.
The ``run.sh`` file is a simple Bash script listing the ``python`` commands
we used to run ``exper1_mathjax.py`` to generate the experiments and
the ``report.html`` file.
