__Preface.__
This easy-to-read tutorial uses a specific case, exponential decay
models, to introduce the basic ingredients of mathematical modeling on
computers: model derivation, finite difference methods, computational
algorithms, implementation in Python, software testing, visualization,
as well as detailed analysis of the quality of numerical results. The
primary focus is on how mathematical methods are translated to
reusable and well-tested software.  Many classical subjects in
scientific computing are covered in addition to software topics like
user interfaces, unit testing frameworks, class programming, and
automating computer experiments.

========= Generalizations =========

It is time to consider generalizations of the simple decay model
$u^{\prime}=-au$ and also to look at additional numerical solution
methods.  We consider first variable coefficients, $u^{\prime}=a(t)u +
b(t)$, and later a completely general scalar ODE $u^{\prime}=f(u,t)$
and its generalization to a system of such general ODEs.  Among
numerical methods, we treat implicit multi-step methods, and several
families of explicit methods: Leapfrog schemes, Runge-Kutta methods,
and Adams-Bashforth formulas.
