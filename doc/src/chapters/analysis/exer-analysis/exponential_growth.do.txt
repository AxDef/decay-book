TITLE: Analysis of schemes for exponential growth

We study

!bt
\[ u^{\prime}(t) = -au(t),\quad u(0)=I,\]
!et
with $a<0$ such that the ODE models exponential growth with
analytical solution $u(t)=Ie^{-at}$.

=== Simulations ===

The schemes are exactly the same as in the case $a>0$.
A program solving the problem numerically is shown below.

@@@CODE exer-decay/exponential.py fromto: from numpy import@# Exercise b

# #if FORMAT == 'ipynb'
!bc pycod
dt_values = [3.0, 0.5, 0.1, 0.01]
for dt in dt_values:
    demo(dt)
!ec
# #else
We can try different $\Delta t$ values: 3, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.01.

=== Analysis ===

The amplification factor is the same as when $a>0$, but here we introduce
$p=-a\Delta t>0$ since $a<0$:

!bt
\begin{equation}
A(p) = \frac{1+(1-\theta)p}{1-\theta p}.
\end{equation}
!et
A major problem is that the denominator can be zero when $a<0$. This
happens for $p=1/\theta$. The exact amplification factor is $\Aex = e^{p}$.

Here is code for computing and plotting the factors:

@@@CODE exer-decay/exponential.py fromto: # Exercise b@if __name

# #if FORMAT == 'ipynb'
plot_amplification_factors('FE BE CN'.split())
# #else
