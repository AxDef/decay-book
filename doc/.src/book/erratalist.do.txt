Some will claim that it is an error
when we do not inlcude the added mass term $m_aa$ in
the equation of motion in Section ref{decay:app:drag}
*Vertical motion of a body in a viscous fluid*.
For motion in a gas, $m_aa$ can be neglected in comparison with
$ma$, but in a liquid, we have $m_aa = \frac{1}{2}\varrho V$, where
$\varrho$ is the density of the liquid, and $V$ is the volume of a
spherical body.
